124,4/17/2014,epic-workbench,An Epic DIY Workbench… With Mood Lighting,Check out this epic workbench I created that features LEDs as well as a whole host of other cool features.,"When I started building this version, I didn't have any plans, just a basic idea, and kind of put it together as I went. I wanted it to have built in electrical outlets, cabinets, and my flush mount router station. But once I got going with it, I saw where I could put a custom sign, which of course meant I needed to light it. If I was going to install LED lighting for the sign, I thought maybe it would be awesome to install it on the understand of the entire worktop. I found the light set at superbrightleds.com, and in truth, the LED's cost nearly as much as all the wood and materials on the rest of the bench! Hopefully it was worth it.I wanted the bench to look industrial, so I found a 4'x8' sheet of diamond plated aluminum at a local metal/steel company for about $100.00. I used my jigsaw to cut it into strips, and used some 2x8 pine board to bend it to 90º angles for the corners. I'm really happy with how it turned out. It took a lot of time, effort, blood and sweat, but I'm hoping it will be a permanent and useful addition to my project videos. The materials for wood, paint and other accessories was about $400, and the LED strip kit was about $300.00. I can't put a price on my labor, but it was 2 solid weeks, all day every day so I could get it done, and keep making videos without missing an upload.In any case, it's never going anywhere. It won't fit through any door, and the thing probably weighs about 400lbs!I hope you like it!--Project inspired by: A local craftsman, named Bryce, who works out of his home. He gave me a tour of his shop, and had designed a router station very similar to my first prototype.

120,3/25/2014,silimy-toilet-prank,This Is The Most Disgusting Prank Ever,Check out this disgusting prank to make your toilet look like it's filled with green slimy goo!,"A harmless prank clogs somebody's toilet with a slimy green ooze.

WARNING: This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Pyrotechnics are not toys, and should be handled with extreme caution and respect. Homemade rockets, no matter how small, may not be legal in your area. Resulting damage may not be covered by your insurance. Check city laws and ordinances before attempting. Use of this video content is at your own risk. A viewer on a previous video asked if these types of fuses could be used to make a small rocket, in the same way a visco fuse rocket was made. At the time, I wasn't familiar with what a Visco fuse rocket was, so did some experiments, and came up with these. I've found they shoot around 50-100 feet, many times landing on the roof of my house. The tape needs to be wrapped tightly around the nozzle to get a good launch. If the tape is too loose, the fuel seems to blow out the end and the rocket doesn't go very far. This poses a risk of burning fuse for a few seconds that fly out in all random directions.I experimented in controlled conditions, and away from anything flammable. Safety equipment was on hand at all times.Music by http://www.MachinimaSound.com (Dust Sucker)"

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:To fold the candle, we're going to follow 8 simple steps. 1. Start with a square napkin, and turn it slightly so that one point is facing up. 2. Now take the bottom tip, and fold it up toward the top until the two corners match. This should form a rough triangle.3. The next step is fold the base up just a couple of inches and press it down flat. 4. At this point, we can flip the whole thing over, so the triangle is pointing to the left.5. Take the bottom point and fold it up so the tip is just past the center. 6. Start rolling the whole thing into a tube, starting from the bottom, and working toward the top. When your roll is finished, you might want to push the uneven ends back into the tube, then tuck the loose end, neatly into the cuff. This should give you a nice sturdy base to hold your napkin upright. 7. To finish off, just turn one layer of the tip down.8. Then shape the the other layer to look like a flame. Now your candle looks like it's burning, with a bit of wax dripping off the top. It's completely finished, and ready to impress. Now if you don't have cloth napkins, try making this with a paper napkin instead.

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:We can make the ""Elf Shoe"" in 8 fairly simple steps. 1. Fold a square napkin in half, from the bottom to the top.2. Then fold it again from the top to the bottom. 3. Now find the center, and fold the two sides in, the same way you'd fold a paper airplane. 4. Go ahead and continue this idea, by folding the sides in again, forming a sharp point at the tip. 5. At this point, the two halves can fold over on each other, and when you flatten them out, check which side is open, and make sure it's facing to the bottom. 6. Now focus on the loose parts at the back, and fold the top layer up and out of the way. 7. The bottom layer folds in half, then wraps over the top layer, tucking neatly into the little flap in the side of the shoe. 8. All that's left now, is to turn down the loose material sticking up at the top, to form a little cuff. Your little elf shoe napkin is finished and ready for showing off. If you try making one out of a paper napkin it will probably look something like this. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean."

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:To make the ""Basket"", we're going to follow 7 steps.1. First off, go ahead and fold a square napkin diagonally, to form a triangle.2. Fold the base up about 3 or 4 inches from the bottom. 3. Now flip the whole thing over so the triangle is pointing to the left.4. Take the top point and fold it down so it's just short of the bottom by a couple of inches. 5. Fold the bottom point, a few inches past the top edge, and tuck it around the backside of the pouch. 6. Fold the point of the top layer, down over the front of the pouch.7. Fold the back layer, down over the back side. Go ahead and straighten up the edges, fluff up the pouch a bit, and your basket is finished. If you tie a ribbon around the top, it adds an amazing amount of stability, and of course the same folds will work on paper napkins as well.

This is sure to impress whoever your date may be.,"How to fold a square napkin into The ""Rose"". A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:The ""Rose"" can be folded in just 6 easy steps. 1. Get started with a square napkin, and fold each of the 4 corners into the center as best you can. Most napkins aren't perfectly square, but just do the best you can, with what you've got. 2. The next step is to take the 4 new corners, and fold them into the center as well. 3. Now just hold everything together at the middle, and flip the napkin over. 4. Let's repeat the process again, by taking these 4 corners, and folding them into the middle like we did the the others. 5. Ok, we're just about done, so to finish up, hold the center firmly with one hand, and gently pull the tips from underneath the corners, until they look like flower petals. 6. When you've done this to each of the 4 corners, do the same thing, to the undersides of the edges. This will make little points stick out between your rose petals, and give the whole thing a nice symmetrical balance. This adds an amazing decorative flare to your dinner presentation, and if you don't have any cloth napkins, these can look great with paper napkins as well. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean."

WARNING: The ideas and examples demonstrated in the video are suggestions for practical development of strong memorable passwords based on my personal research and experience. Having a strong password will not guarantee your accounts cannot be compromised. There are many people with many ways to trick you into giving out personal information. See below for links to more information on how you can be better protected. Use of video content is at own risk. Helpful Hints for Extra Security: - Have you already been hacked? .. Contact your web service and follow steps for recovering account. Change passwords to all compromised accounts asap. You can find contact information and guidance at http://www.staysafeonline.org/stay-sa...- Never click the link on an email that asks you to log into your account. For example, if you get an email claiming to be from ""Paypal"", ""eBay"" or any other sensitive site asking you to log in, it's probably a phishing scam. To be safe, log into the account by going directly to their website. - Avoid forwarding emails to multiple recipients. Forwarding mass emails is a great way for hackers to collect lists of passwords, and begin phishing for sensitive personal information. To be save, avoid forwarding mass emails, and do not click on links in suspicious emails. - If an email looks suspicious, don't even open it. Why write down passwords on a piece of paper? ""Simply, people can no longer remember passwords good enough to reliably defend against dictionary attacks, and are much more secure if they choose a password too complicated to remember and then write it down. We're all good at securing small pieces of paper. I recommend that people write their passwords down on a small piece of paper, and keep it with their other valuable small pieces of paper: in their wallet."" —Bruce Schneier, 2005 Like any security measure, super strong passwords will not guarantee you ultimate protection, but these ideas are simple, and are certainly the first line of defense in protecting your accounts.Once again, special thanks to http:/www.intel.com/lifehacks for supporting this project.

And here's how to make it with a few simple ingredients, and a bit of dry-ice http://www.thekingofrandom.com Music by http://www.MachinimaSound.com (Queen Of The Night) Project inspired by: Theo Gray (Mad Science) http://youtu.be/gyLwYin6pRo **A couple of points I probably didn't clarify were 1. That there is no dry ice left in the mixture when the ice cream is done, and 2. My wife and I had already eaten the majority of the batch before we gave it to our kids to test out for themselves. I hope that helps those of you who had concerns. WARNING: Dry Ice is extremely cold! (-78C/-109F) and can cause instant frost-bite to exposed skin. This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Ingestion of dry-ice can cause serious internal tissue damage. If Dry Ice is ingested, drink copious amounts of warm water as soon as practical. Misuse, or careless use may result in serious injury. Use of this video content is at your own risk. This simple vanilla ice cream recipe is easy, and delicious! 2 cups Half & Half 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 1/2 Cup Powdered Sugar Note: Half & Half is a dairy product consisting of half light cream and half milk. If you have heavy whipping cream and milk, you can make half and half by combining four parts whole milk with one part heavy cream. If you only have light whipping cream, use three parts whole milk and one part light whipping cream.Mix all ingredients together, and add some cold. (In this case, dry ice!)The dry ice cools the liquid mixture to the point where it takes on the familiar qualities of ice cream.I love this method because it adds a mysterious flowing fog quality to the process that's very visually stimulating, and gratifying.When the fog stops, the dry ice has most likely all sublimated out, but be careful when eating, and watch for any small pieces that may have been missed, and avoid eating them. Because the CO2 sublimates directly into a gas, it's very clean and doesn't leave behind any residue. Dry ice is solid CO2, and as it sublimates through the mix, it forms carbonic acid with some of the water in the mix, giving the ice cream the familiar fizzy carbonated taste that we associate with soda.Dry ice from fire extinguishers? In some cases, yes!. Select fire extinguishers utilize CO2 as the medium for suppressing fires. These types are mainly found in restaurant kitchens, mechanical rooms, and in areas that hold sensitive equipment like computers. CO2 fire extinguishers are usually charged with food grade CO2 and are referred to in terms of pounds. For example, a 5lb CO2 extinguisher is charged with a 5 lb weight of liquid CO2. The extinguisher is then highly pressurized. CO2 fire extinguishers are marked with stickers, or holes punched in the servicing labels. They also have unusually large discharge horns, and no pressure gauges. You can see how to make Dry Ice with a CO2 Fire extinguisher in this video: http://youtu.be/tLNHDxd6nDc"

I chose to use just a couple wraps of aluminum foil because the material is light weight and would break fairly easily as the pressure built. I wasn't interested in building a bomb.

In this experiment, 2 scrambled eggs were cooked with solar power within 20-40 seconds. I used a black metal cooking pan that was pre-heated and buttered, so when the eggs were added, there was plenty of heat to cook them. If trying to cook eggs sunny side up, it's a bit more difficult because the egg whites reflect a lot of the heat, and don't cook as fast. But pre-heating the pan is a great option before adding the eggs. With scrambled eggs, the yoke is mixed throughout, turning the entire mix a deep yellow. This absorbs heat from the sun a little more readily, and helps it cook faster. I was amazed at the power that could be harnessed from the sun, so I tried building one of these ""Solar Death Rays"" for myself. I call this device the ""Solar Scorcher"".

For other project videos, check out http://www.thekingofrandom.com Music by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.com WARNING: There were no fish in this fish pond at the time of this experiment. Sodium is an extremely reactive metal and will produce extreme heat, NaOH, and explosive Hydrogen gas. Molten sodium can be thrown out of the water and cause caustic burns to skin, and damage to eyes. Use of video content is at own risk. Sodium is an extremely reactive metal and the reaction with water produces jets of hydrogen gas below the waterline. When the sodium gets trapped under the piece of wood, enough heat can be generated to boil the water around the metal and actually melt the sodium. If the sodium gets hot enough, the hydrogen jets can ignite and burn. Burning hydrogen makes the temperature rise even faster. The rate of the reaction increases so quickly that an explosion may occur! Molten sodium can be thrown out of the dish and leave burns on skin. Wear goggles and stand behind a safety shield when you're anywhere near this reaction. Inspired by: A friend named Dustin. He said his scout group would put chunks of sodium metal in a wheel barrow full of water, then throw a piece of wood on it to make it explode and blast the wood up into the air.

Alcohol is extremely flammable, and can continue burning while sticking to hands, as well as other objects. This should not be attempted indoors or near anything flammable. Drinking isopropyl alcohol has an immediate effect on the central nervous system. Isopropyl alcohol slows these functions and may shut them down altogether which can lead to coma. Use of video content is at own risk. To get this effect, I soaked a few cotton-balls in 70% isopropyl alcohol and lit them with an open flame from a BBQ ignitor. The flame starts off small, but soon engulfs the entire ball. In low light conditions, a flame up to 6"" can be observed rising from the ball. Because the flame rises, holding the ball near the bottom helps minimize the heat to the hand, and in some cases, the flaming ball can be held for extended periods of time with minor discomfort."
72,8/3/2013,diy-pump,Handy DIY PVC Pump with Tons of Uses!,Make this pump out of PVC and go ahead and use it for all sorts of projects down the line.,"In this project you'll learn how to make a customizable PVC hand pump that will create vacuum suction, pump water, or compress air. http://www.thekingofrandom.com A pre-requisite to making the pump will be 2 homemade check valves. You can learn how to make these cheap PVC check valves here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG6own... Music by Jason Shaw (TU-ForeverBelieve) http://www.audionautix.com My friend NightHawkInLight made another version of a vacuum pump. Check it out here: http://youtu.be/UkPLu6mgdWA Project inspired by: This is an original design, based off a picture I once found on a google image search. (I haven't been able to find the picture since) WARNING: Power tools, like a table saw, pose risks of serious injury. Adequate training and experience are required before operating. The results and claims of this pump are based solely on my personal experiences with the one demonstrated in the video. Individual results may vary. The pump is a simple design and not made, or claimed, to be used in any heavy duty operations, or relatively high pressures. Use of this content is at your own risk. I've wanted to build a PVC water pump for awhile, but the check valves were around $10.00 each. That seemed a little steep for a PVC build, so I made my own, which you can see in a different project.  I was inspired on the pump piston and chamber by a picture I saw on a google image search by someone who used the 1-1/4"" and 1"" sizes of tubes, and he mentioned he cut the grooves for the O-rings on a table saw. That was a new idea to me and gave me the inspiration to put this together. I'm also planning to use this piston design in future projects that require pneumatic and hydraulic pistons. In my testing, the valves work great with air and water. I didn't have any gauges to test the strength of the vacuum so can't say how strong the vacuum would be, but it certainly does create one. While there are some special tools used to create this pump (table saw and forester bit), I believe with a little creativity the pump could be made just as effectively without them, making this a simple and duplicatable design."

70,7/18/2013,one-way-valve,The Cheapest Valve for Your Super Soaker or Pump!,"This valve can be used for all sorts of purposes! By doing itself, you can save a ton of money the next time you need one for a DIY","The most expensive parts of a water pump, or DIY Super Soaker, are usually the check valves. In this project, we're making some from scratch, for as little as $0.35 each. http://www.thekingofrandom.com Music by Jason Shaw (TU-GetAMoveOn) http://www.audionautix.com Project inspired by: WaterWolf http://www.sscentral.org/homemade/che... WARNING: The pressure tests and claims made on these check-valves is based solely on my personal experiences with the ones demonstrated in the video. Individual results may vary, and caution and care should be taken when loading the valves with high pressure. The risk of higher pressures is that the balls may be forced from the adaptor, shooting out like projectiles. High pressures may also cause the ball to lock up, preventing normal operation of the valve, or possibly even structural failure of the valve altogether. These valves are not made, or claimed, to be used in any heavy duty operations. Use of this content is at your own risk. I wanted to build a PVC water pump, but the check valves were around $10.00 each. That seemed a little steep for a PVC build, so while looking for alternative options, I settled on this design, which is about the cheapest, while still being practical and useful, that I could imagine. In my testing, the valves work great with air and water. Air pressures up to 60PSI seemed to be fine for normal operation, while pressures above 60PSI occasionally caused the ball to lock into the O-Ring, and required substantial ""back-pressure"" to unlock it.  If you try using rubber bouncy balls as the valve mechanism, only use them in very low pressure applications like blowing up balloons, and possibly for improvised water guns. Relatively high pressures used with these balls seems to eventually force them out of the adaptor, and can shoot them out at surprising velocities. Overall, I'm really happy with the valves because they can be fit into any part of a PVC system, and can be duplicated quickly, easily, and for very very low cost."

This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Pyrotechnics are not toys, and should be handled with extreme caution and respect. High temperatures on the stove or oven may cause auto-ignition of the pyrotechnic composition which may lead to serious injury, death, and/or permanent damage to equipment and property. Ignition of an incendiary or explosive material may not be legal in your area, and resulting damage may not be covered by your insurance. Check city laws and ordinances before attempting. Use of this video content is at your own risk.   These sparklers are nearly identical to the slow burning fuses made in a previous project (http://youtu.be/w-H02hwvVgI). The only difference is, this time I tried adding food coloring for effect, and a clothespin as a holder to help prevent burns to fingers. This is the recipe for making a ""sparkle stick""; -60 mL Water (Heated on medium heat) -36 grams KNO3 (Potassium Nitrate) which I obtained in the form of stump remover -24 grams White Sugar -1-20 drops of food coloring (Color to suit your preference) Note: White/Gray smoke is the only color emitted, even if you use different colored dyes. Colored smoke cannot be made with KNO3. Shake the Sugar and KNO3 together to get an intimate mixture, then pour into the water and stir until dissolved. Soak about 12 feet of 100% cotton yarn in the solution, then space evenly on a cookie tray. Bake in an oven at 150ºC (300ºF) for about 20 minutes, making sure to lift the yarn at 10 minutes to make sure it doesn't stick to the pan. Let cool for 5-10 minutes. Cut to desired size, and place in clothespin. Put on gloves and safety glasses, light your sparkler, and enjoy! The sparks are much more noticeable at night when there is very little light. During the day, the smoke is more visible. Personally, I think both effects are awesome. Gloves are recommended as bits of burning fuel will occasionally fly off, and can burn the skin. If the sparkler burns too fast, wait a few hours, or days to try again. The composition is hygroscopic and will absorb moisture from the air, reducing the rate of burn until eventually it won't light at all. If you want to revive an old batch that has absorbed too much moisture, re-bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 150ºC (300ºF). These types of devices may not be legal to make or use in your area, so check local laws before attempting to duplicate this project, and as always, be safe and aware of your environment before igniting anything flammable!"

The effect is seen in the blue glass, and the clear glass in the video and, in my opinion, was worth the effort!To get this effect, I put multiple unopened bottles of ""PUREFLO"" (http://www.pureflo.com) bottled water in the freezer for 2 hours and 45 minutes exactly. The purified water gets supercooled, and when it touches an ice crystal, it turns instantly to ice. It will also do this if the bottle is hit hard enough. This was a really fun project, and one of my favorites because it's safe, awe inspiring, and anyone can do it."

It&#39;s a fitting name since the system acts similar to a Variac. The idea is to use a water based medium as an electrolytic resistor. A bit of electrolyte is added to the solution to make it slightly conductive, and when two electrodes are placed in the solution, the allow more or less current to flow, depending on whether there are closer or further apart.<br /><br />Although I&#39;ve taken thought to minimize risks in operation, I have to stress that I don&#39;t consider this device safe or fool proof. It has the potential to be lethal, and even though I show step-by-step how it was made, this is more of a &quot;How I did&quot; project rather than a &quot;How to&quot;."

The most that&#39;s been shown is to lay a bead on a piece of metal, which I didn&#39;t feel was very credible because this doesn&#39;t prove it can weld.  My earlier experiments with 1 MOT could also lay a bead, but it didn&#39;t have enough heat or penetration to make anything stick.  A welder also needs a way to reliably control the amperage (which no other project does).  I saw one project where dimmer switches were used on the primary coils, however dimmer switches are only able to handle around 600 watts, and these stick welders require upwards of 2,000-3,000 watts.  In my experience, the dimmer switches fail very quickly and within a couple minutes of trying to weld.<br /><br />I&#39;m happy to say that the welder in my project does work for me.  It welds 1/16&quot; AC rods very well, and I believe the transformer temperatures are very reasonable and sustainable for the amount of welding I plan to do as a simple hobbiest welder."

You could probably save some money by scavenging for free wire, but I decided to look at the &quot;end of coil&quot; section at the hardware store, and was able to negotiate a deal for half price on the cable, so the 50&#39; only cost me about $17.<br /><br />The modified MOTs will have a new secondary that is 18 turns of the 8 AWG cable, and both MOTs are tied together in series.

There are even a couple of tutorials suggesting how to  do it.  However, in my experience of trying to duplicate these projects, my MOT welder either got so hot that the insulation on the wires melted and shorted it out, and/or it didn&#39;t provide enough power to strike and maintain an arc.<br /><br />The idea of the Microwave Welder isn&#39;t new, but to date, I personally haven&#39;t come across a video or project where anyone actually welded anything with one of these &quot;so-called&quot; microwave welders.  The most that&#39;s been shown is to lay a bead on a piece of metal, which I didn&#39;t feel was very credible because this doesn&#39;t prove it can weld.  My earlier experiments with 1 MOT could also lay a bead, but it didn&#39;t have enough heat or penetration to make anything stick.  A welder also needs a way to reliably control the amperage (which no other project does).  I saw one project where dimmer switches were used on the primary coils, however dimmer switches are only able to handle around 600 watts, and these stick welders require upwards of 2,000-3,000 watts.  In my experience, the dimmer switches fail very quickly and within a couple minutes of trying to weld.<br /><br />I&#39;m happy to say that the welder in my project does work for me.  It welds 1/16&quot; AC rods very well, and I believe the transformer temperatures are very reasonable and sustainable for the amount of welding I plan to do as a simple hobbiest welder."

Proper eye protection and ventilation are recommended. I run the system on 240 VAC, which is metered by a power controller I built called the &quot;Scariac&quot;. It&#39;s similar to the idea of a Variac (variable auto-controller), with a few more hazards to be aware of. The Micro-Welder itself does not have an on-off switch, and can pose a fire hazard if plugged directly into a mains power socket. I made this to be used exclusively with the Scariac. (Look for how to build that in another project.) Stick welding, and/or the modification of a Microwave Oven Transformer (M.O.T), can be very dangerous and presents risk of UV radiation, shock hazards, burns, fires, fumes and a multitude of other risks. This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />This video is the end result of 3 other project videos which will be edited and uploaded over the next couple of months. Those videos will show how I modified the transformers, and how to control the current, but they aren&#39;t available at the moment, hence the &quot;Coming Soon&quot; on the annotations.<br /><br /> This project video comes after quite a bit of thinking and experimenting with different ways to modify the microwave stick welder into something that actually works, and would actually be a useful tool to have around the shop.<br /><br />There are a few videos on the internet that show various people who have tried making a stick welder from a Microwave Oven Transformer. There are even a couple of tutorials suggesting how to do it. However, in my experience of trying to duplicate these projects, my MOT welder either got so hot that the insulation on the wires melted and shorted it out, and/or it didn&#39;t provide enough power to strike and maintain an arc.<br /><br />To date, I haven&#39;t seen a video or project where anyone actually welded anything with one of these &quot;so-called&quot; microwave welders.

It&#39;s more of a novelty than anything practical, but in my experience, the image is watchable and the idea will hopefully be enjoyed.  If anything, it&#39;s a party trick you can pull out for your next get-together with friends.  The image projected on the wall will be &quot;mirror image&quot; or &quot;flipped horizontally&quot; from the original image.  This will make any text or numbers appear backward.  The light from the Laptop, Smartphone or Tablet is the only source of light, so as the image is made bigger, the intensity of the light on the screen gets weaker until eventually the image becomes indiscernible.<br /><br />Project inspired by: This was an original idea.  (That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m the first one to do it, just that the idea is new to me and I haven&#39;t seen it done before.)  While visiting family in 2012, I found that by magnifying the screen of my smartphone through a sphere-shaped water bottle, I could project an image on the wall.  To make a better quality image required a larger magnifier, but a magnifying glass was impractical because it would be so large, heavy and expensive.  A friend requested I do this project for March Madness, so I devoted some time and thought into it, and this is what resulted.<br /><br />The projector is very simple.  It&#39;s made of cardboard, duct-tape, and a Fresnel lens about 7&quot;-10&quot;.<br /><br />I found that using a Laptop works the best, because the screen is larger to begin with, and it can be turned up fairly brightly.  This is good because as the image is made bigger, the intensity of the light on the screen is lessened.  An image of 50&quot; is very watchable on a Laptop, as well as a Tablet about the size of an iPad.  Of course, the closer your bring the projector to the screen, the smaller the image will be, but the brighter and more focused it will become.<br /><br />I found that if you cover all your windows and close any doors to make sure the room is completely dark, this will help the image appear crisper and brighter.  <br /><br />Because the Fresnel lens is made flat, there are some optical disadvantages that appear in the image.  For example, the edges of the screen may be a little blurry while the center is in focus.  To address this problem, a shroud can be added to the lens with a rectangular hole in the center about the size of a credit card.  This will choke down the aperture, and dramatically improve the focus.  The trade off is that there will be less light emitted from the projector, so the image on the screen will be dimmed.<br /><br />A Smartphone works the same way, but the screen size can&#39;t go much over 20&quot; or the image is unwatchable.  15&quot; worked great, and 20&quot; was ok.  Some Smartphones don&#39;t have an option to lock the screen sideways so you may have to download an app for that."

I had been playing around with making candles with vegetable oil and was about to make a video on some ways to do that.  One night an idea popped into my head about melted butter and I wondered if that would work.<br /><br />WARNING: An open flame poses a fire hazard.  Do not use near any flammable or explosive material.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />To make butter burn, we actually need to vaporize it first!<br /><br />A bit of rolled up toilet paper acts as a wick, and when pushed down into the center of a block of butter and ignited, we&#39;ve may have created the worlds simplest candle.  <br /><br />The butter below the wick begins to melt and soak up into the paper.  The heat aids the liquid butter to be released as a vapor, and it&#39;s the vapor that&#39;s flammable.<br /><br />I used an 8oz block of butter and cut it in half.  Each half burns for about 4 hours each, however, during the last 2 hours it seems most of the butter liquifies and your wick may need some support.  I used a paperclip to give some stability.<br /><br />Another idea would be to cut the butter into 8 sections of 1oz each and make 8 candles!  Each ounce should burn for about 1 hour.</p>"

Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br /> It cost just under $30 to refill the tank to get about 2 lbs of dry-ice. Contrasting that with the cost of dry-ice at the local grocery store ($1.00/lb) doesn&#39;t make financial sense, but this method is much more fun!<br /><br />If pressurized liquid CO2 is quickly depressurized, the CO2 expands to a gas, and cools its surroundings. This is called adiabatic cooling. Because the CO2 sublimates directly into a gas, it&#39;s very clean and doesn&#39;t leave behind any residue. <br /><br />Some fire extinguishers utilize CO2 as the medium for suppressing fires. These types are mainly found in restaurant kitchens, mechanical rooms, and in areas that hold sensitive equipment like computers. <br /><br />CO2 fire extinguishers are usually charged with food grade CO2 and are referred to in terms of pounds. For example, a 5lb CO2 extinguisher is charged with a 5 lb weight of liquid CO2. <br /><br />CO2 fire extinguishers are marked with stickers, or holes punched in the servicing labels. They also have unusually large discharge horns, and no pressure gauges."

Not only do they launch rockets, and fire clouds of raining candy, they can also be used to fire water balloons .. and these things really fly!<br /><br />I made a simple mod for the Rocket Rifle by attaching a 2&#39; length of 2&quot; PVC tubing, with some reducer fittings, so that it screws into the 1&quot; in-line sprinkler valve.  It&#39;s as easy as that!<br /><br />Testing out some small water balloons from the dollar store, we lost sight of them after a couple hundred feet.  That means these water balloons are blasting over 300 feet away!  Your friends don&#39;t stand a chance!<br /><br />The balloon blasters are powered by compressed air, so to charge the system, you can either hook them up to an air compressor, or modify the valve to accept a bicycle pump.  <br /><br />A manual valve built into the systems allows the air chambers to be charged with air, then closed, trapping the air in the system, and making the balloon cannons completely portable!  You may only get 1 or 2 shots off before having to re-charge however, so strategy will come into play!<br /><br />With the Candy Cannon, I was able to load up 17 water balloons at once!  And rather than just shooting them aimlessly, I targeted my neighbors house.  Hopefully they realize that was just &quot;friendly&quot; fire."

There are no voltage regulators, no diodes and no capacitors to smooth the current.  There may a risk in charging lithium-ion batteries without a proper battery charging circuit recommended by the manufacturer.  It worked fine for me, but if you try this on your phone, make sure you understand, and are comfortable, with the risks.  Back up your data in case your phone is adversely affected and your data or equipment is damaged as a result.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.  By running an electric motor backwards, you can generate electricity.  <br /><br />When using a cordless drill, remove the battery pack so you&#39;re not fighting the back EMF, and press the trigger button in to allow the electrical connection to be made.  Now all you have to do is twist the rotating end of the drill, and you&#39;ll be generating electricity at the contact points where the battery would normally connect.  On my drill, a cranking speed of 100 RPM yielded about 5 volts DC.<br /><br />A few household items will make it practical to use.  For example, a crank handle (made from a mixing beater and a salad fork) will give better leverage for cranking.  Some aluminum foil that&#39;s been rolled up into a wire will help direct the electricity to the point of use.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The faster and harder you can crank the drill, the higher voltage, and more amperage you can extract.  <br /><br />Ideally, this could be hooked up to a bike, water power, or a windmill to generate effortless energy, and if done carefully, the energy could be stored in a battery for later use."

I&#39;ve been able to get 3 shots off before having to recharge, however each successive shot is less powerful. <br /><br />When the trigger (momentary switch) is pushed, the 9 volt battery sends a current to the sprinkler valve allowing it to open and release the air.  The blast of air is powerful enough to send these rockets out of sight."

The paper and foam versions that I was introduced to would blow up on any pressure over 40 PSI. This was an original design.<br /><br />WARNING: This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Be aware of your environment and do not fire projectiles at any living thing. Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury or property damage. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />These little rockets are about as simple as they get, and yet they are impressively durable. 1 sheet of computer paper is used to form a spacer and the rocket body, then electrical tape is wrapped up the body to reinforce the tube. Electrical tape works great because it can withstand the 135 PSI pressure from the rocket launcher made in a different project. <br /><br />The fins are made from cardboard, and are about 1/3 as tall as the rocket, and as wide as the width of the body. I use 4 fins because I found that 3 sometimes left the rocket unstable when airborne. 4 fins keep the rocket very straight, and if shot straight up, it can achieve heights that put it out of sight. Trying to catch it on the way back down can result in a red welt on your hand. I speak from experience. <br /><br />The rockets hold together great and can be shot multiple times. I&#39;ve noticed that in time, the glue holding the fins starts to give way and a fin may fall off. The extra wraps of tape over the tips and base of the fins help improve the life of the rocket.

During pyrolysys, gasses such as hydrogen and methane are released from the fabric, and can be ignited and burned. <br /><br />The process of making char cloth is very similar to making wood gas, and the gas released can be captured and burned as fuel.<br /><br />Char cloth can be ignited by a single spark, that can in turn be used to ignite a tinder bundle to start a fire.  Sometimes it&#39;s difficult to ignite tinder directly, and char cloth provides a means that makes the process extremely simple."

By turning the bottle upside down and using the rounded convex part at the top, we can use a water bottle as a make-shift magnifying lens.  <br /><br />The curved water refracts the sunlight, and give the ability to focus it.  The closer the rounded lens is to resembling a liquid sphere, the better it will work.  If bubbled are trapped in the bottle, they will distort the sunlight and weaken the intensity of the beam.<br /><br />This technique isn&#39;t easy, and takes a lot of practice to master, so don&#39;t wait until you&#39;re in a survival situation to try it."

Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />NOTE: <br /><br />This is not a &quot;free energy&quot; device, &quot;over unity&quot; device, or a claim to be the solution to the worlds energy crisis.  This is a project I did to experiment with the electrolysis of water, and the resulting gasses collected.<br /><br />I have not tried this HHO fuel to operate engines, although many people claim they have done it with success.<br /><br />ABOUT: <br /><br />The generator requires electricity to electrolyze H2O (water) into gas.  The resulting mixed gas is H2 and O2.  I typically hook this up to my car battery while the vehicle is running, so the alternator takes most of the load.  On 12 volts I get about 1.5 liters/minute, but when I want to make the gas faster, I hook 2 car batteries in series for 24 volts, and this exponentially increases the gas production to over 5 liters per minute.<br /><br />Current draw seems to be around 20-50 amps depending on whether you use 12-24 volts.  High current draws mean the electrolyte heats up, and if left too long the plastic can warp or melt causing structural failure.<br /><br />Some people ask why the plates aren&#39;t all electrically connected.  The plates that aren&#39;t connected are called &quot;floater&quot; plates, or &quot;neutral&quot; plates.  There is too much information to post about them here, so do a google search, or check out websites like <a href=""http://www.hho4free.com/neutral_plates.htm"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.hho4free.com/neutral_plates.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://www.hho4free.com/neutral_plate...</a> for an in depth explanation of the theory.<br /><br />I used KOH as my electrolyte because research suggested it was the best.  I haven&#39;t experimented with other electrolytes, but have heard that salt, sodium hydroxide, vinegar, etc could work, but will dirty and may corrode the plates.  Potassium Hydroxide keeps the system clean, however, it is caustic, so be careful if you choose to use it.  You can probably get away with about 2-4 teaspoons of KOH per 6 liters of water.<br /><br />This system produces an extremely powerful OxyHydrogen gas.  When the gas is used, it simply turns back into water, and that&#39;s good for the environment.  However I believe it takes more electric energy to produce the gas than is obtained from the gas.  This device merely converts the energy from one form to another, with given losses.<br /><br />As long as you have enough electricity, the amount of water already in this system is enough to produce thousands and thousands of liters of fuel.  Some people say this is the fuel of the future.  Either way, it&#39;s a very powerful gas!<br /><br />If you need more information, or want to purchase build plans for this design, send an email request to grant@thekingofrandom.com."

Colored liquids, or liquids in colored bottles can still work, but energy is lost, and that could be the difference between getting tinder ignition or not.<br /><br />After making fires with various water bottles, and posting my first video on it in 2010, someone commented and said they saw a guy on Dual Survival do it with his urine. That sounded pretty amazing to me, so I looked up the link on YouTube and saw the clip.<br /><br />It seemed like he had quite a bit of trouble actually getting his fire going, and I thought that if I were ever in a survival situation like that, the last thing I would want to be doing is trying for hours how to figure out how it works. It&#39;s better to be prepared beforehand.<br /><br />This video comes after many experiments of playing with various techniques. I found that using plastic wrap and urine made a combination that gave great success, and within a minute or two I could have a flame! When done correctly, it works just the same as a magnifying glass. <br /><br />Practicing with the amount of pressure is key, because too little and you won&#39;t have a good lens. Too much, and the plastic bursts and you&#39;re soaking wet.<br /><br />FAQ&#39;s: <br /><br />Q: Why did I wrap an apple in plastic wrap?<br /><br />A: Of course the video is fictional, however the survival techniques portrayed are real. I wrapped my apple with plastic wrap because I&#39;ve seen it done before at hotels, and I wanted to give an example of how random resources can be used as tools. If you don&#39;t wrap your apples in plastic wrap, perhaps you wrap your sandwich, or various other food items? The plastic baggie holding the celery can also be used in a very similar manner.<br /><br />Q: Why did I use a page from the map for tinder instead of grass or leaves? <br /><br />A: This liquid lens technique will light any tinder that could be lit with a magnifying glass, since that&#39;s what it is in essence. I used a piece of paper as an example because most people have access to that as a material they could practice with. I chose paper because it&#39;s easily duplicatable by anyone wanting to try. <br /><br />Q: Why does the urine change color just before I light the tinder? Did I cheat?<br /><br />A: The urine changes color mid video, and that&#39;s because when I went to re-set my camera for a different angled shot, I dropped the first sack of urine. Awkward to hold the sack, and adjust the camera on rocky terrain at the same time. I lost my urine and had to wait for another round .. which, by that point was more hydrated because of all the water I&#39;d drank earlier, and therefore more clear in color. In either case, I have the same success igniting tinder with either liquid lens so the difference made by the color is negligible."

It works because rapid compression heats the air in the chamber to the ignition point of tinders, such as char cloth.

It seemed it mystery how, or when, it actually lit, and I wanted to see. <br /><br />FINDING ACRYLIC: I used google.com to find different plastics companies in my area, and called around until I found one that sold acrylic tubing and rods to the public. I went for a visit, and luckily they had some lengths of scrap tubing they couldn&#39;t sell. I asked them if I could use it for a science project, and they gave it to me for free.<br /><br />The tubing I used was 1/2&quot; inside diameter, and the rod was 1/2&quot; outside diameter - clear acrylic. <br /><br />This piston was given to a subscriber, as part of a contest I held in celebration of 10,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel. <br /><br />See more information on the fire piston on Wikipedia; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston</a>"

Use of this video content is at your own risk.  <br /><br />What do you get when you combine water with a homemade electrolyzer and a car battery?  BOOM!<br /><br />In a previous project, I built a generator that uses electricity to convert water into a very powerful fuel.  The amount of electricity available determines how much gas can be produced.  I&#39;ve got this hooked up to my car battery and have produced up to 5 liters per minute.  I&#39;ve even tried powering it with a makeshift hand-crank generator, but obviously the gas production is slower.  So just how powerful is the gas?  Watch the video to find out!<br /><br />The gas is just a mixture of the H2O molecules broken down into their gaseous elements of two parts Hydrogen and one part Oxygen, which combine as H2 and O2 gas.  This is sometimes called HHO, or Hydroxy gas.  I used a bbq ignitor to see if the bubbles will pop.  <br /><br />Some people might ask what the purpose of the bubbler is.  It helps clean the gas, but more importantly, it acts as a flame arrestor in the event of a flashback.  The bubbler cap is just pressed on, so if there&#39;s a tiny flashback explosion, the worst thing that happens is the cap pops off.  If the bubbler&#39;s a little low on fluid then be careful, because now the gas has a place to build up, and if you were to get a flashback in this situation, it could be a little more dramatic.  It&#39;s helpful to keep the bubbler full, so I made mine detachable for ease of use."

It&#39;s darker in color because it cooked longer, and generally speaking, I think the less it is cooked, the better.  <br /><br />Another batch was made using a mix of 58% Stump Remover, 29% Sugar, and this time I used 13% Corn syrup, and 30mL water.  The water was cooked out the same way as the last, and then about 1 gram of homemade rust powder was added, and stirred in throughly.

Now it can pump out 800 amps of electrical current, so let&#39;s use it to melt some metal!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.thekingofrandom.com"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.thekingofrandom.com"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://www.thekingofrandom.com</a><br /><br />Music by Jason Shaw (RP-PilotsOfStone) <br /><a href=""http://www.audionautix.com"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.audionautix.com"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://www.audionautix.com</a><br /><br />Project inspired by:  codemsan<br /><br />WARNING: Burning galvanized metal may release toxic Zinc Oxide fumes.  This project is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.  Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in severe electric shock, cardiac arrest, serious injury, permanent damage to equipment and property, and/or death. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />By modifying the secondary coil on a MOT, the transformer is converted from a high voltage/low current device into a low voltage/high current metal melter.  The first MOT in the video produces just over 500 amps, and the second one is capable of nearly 800 amps.  <br /><br />Any metal that can conduct such low voltage electricity acts as a resistor between the electrode wires, and heats up due to the extreme electrical friction.<br /><br />I plan to make a new project turning this into a more proper and useful spot welder, although I can find very little use for a spot welder at the moment."
6,9/27/2012,jacobs-ladder,Create Deadly and Dangerous Electric Arcs,"Turn a microwave into your own Jacob's Ladder and create awesome looking, but dangerous, electric arcs!","You can look, but don&#39;t touch!  These arcs of plasma are lethal enough to kill on contact!  In this project We&#39;re using an old Microwave Oven Transformer (MOT) to extract some traveling electric arcs.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.thekingofrandom.com"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.thekingofrandom.com"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://www.thekingofrandom.com</a><br /><br />Music by Jason Shaw (Essense2-1) <br /><a href=""http://www.audionautix.com"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.audionautix.com"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://www.audionautix.com</a><br /><br />Project inspired by:  codemsan <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yYnaOoCfQ&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU5ajgGDvaAmOEA71jO9QD8Q"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yYnaOoCfQ&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU5ajgGDvaAmOEA71jO9QD8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" dir=""ltr"" class=""yt-uix-redirect-link"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7yYna...</a><br /><br />REAL DANGER WARNING: You probably shouldn&#39;t try this at home.  This project is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.  Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in severe electric shock, cardiac arrest, serious injury, permanent damage to equipment and property, and/or death. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: If you attempt to duplicate this project, I suggest wearing THICK INSULATED RUBBER GLOVES, and using a piece of PVC TUBING for your chicken/safety stick.  The gloves I wore, as well as the wooden safety stick, are poor insulators and I used them only because they were what I had on hand, and I was aware and comfortable with the risks, but I cannot recommend they will protect from electric shock.  In any case, always keep one hand behind your back when dealing with HV to reduce the risk of an electrical current from traveling through your heart and sending you into cardiac arrest.<br /><br />By tapping into the secondary coil of an unmodified Microwave Oven Transformer (MOT), and hooking up to a makeshift diverging spark-gap, it&#39;s possible to extract a visible short circuit!<br /><br />These high voltage arcs are probably over an amp in current, and at over 1,000 volts, can be instantly fatal if touched.  <br /><br />As the arc is formed, the surrounding air is ionized and heated, causing the arc to rise.  It will travel up the diverging spark gap, sometimes called a &quot;Jacob&#39;s ladder&quot; until the arc is so weak it breaks.<br /><br />This project is dangerous and isn&#39;t of much practical use as far as I can tell, but was a way to visibly see electricity in plasma form.<br /><br />Because the MOT is unballasted, you can expect the current draw to get so high that the breaker will trip every-time if allowed to continue for an extended period of time."

Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in severe electric shock, serious injury, death, and/or permanent damage to equipment and property.  The pink high voltage insulator on the magnetron is made with beryllium oxide, and is a hazardous material. Regular inhalation of the dust can lead to lung diseases similar to those caused by asbestos. Do not break it.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />I&#39;m super excited about these salvaged parts, because there are a ton of dangerous projects I can use these for.  Like unballasted high voltage electrical arcing, or instantly fatal traveling arcs.  How about improvised spot welding, or dangerously exciting metal melting, and even makeshift AC stick welders?  I feel like I made out like a bandit on this project, and these salvaged components will lay the foundation for many projects to come."

It&#39;s a natural mineral with a chemical formula Na2B4O7 • 10H2O. The IUPAC name for borax is sodium tetraborate decahydrate. Borax also is known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate or disodium tetraborate.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t have access to Borax, I&#39;ve heard that liquid starch can be used instead.  I haven&#39;t tried it, but let me know if you do, and how well it works?  Just mix 1/2 cup liquid starch (eg. Sta-Flo) with an 8oz bottle of glue (should be the whole bottle)."
