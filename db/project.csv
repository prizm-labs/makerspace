epic-workbench,An Epic DIY Workbench… With Mood Lighting,"When I started building this version, I didn't have any plans, just a basic idea, and kind of put it together as I went. I wanted it to have built in electrical outlets, cabinets, and my flush mount router station. But once I got going with it, I saw where I could put a custom sign, which of course meant I needed to light it. If I was going to install LED lighting for the sign, I thought maybe it would be awesome to install it on the understand of the entire worktop. I found the light set at superbrightleds.com, and in truth, the LED's cost nearly as much as all the wood and materials on the rest of the bench! Hopefully it was worth it.I wanted the bench to look industrial, so I found a 4'x8' sheet of diamond plated aluminum at a local metal/steel company for about $100.00. I used my jigsaw to cut it into strips, and used some 2x8 pine board to bend it to 90º angles for the corners. I'm really happy with how it turned out. It took a lot of time, effort, blood and sweat, but I'm hoping it will be a permanent and useful addition to my project videos. The materials for wood, paint and other accessories was about $400, and the LED strip kit was about $300.00. I can't put a price on my labor, but it was 2 solid weeks, all day every day so I could get it done, and keep making videos without missing an upload.In any case, it's never going anywhere. It won't fit through any door, and the thing probably weighs about 400lbs!I hope you like it!--Project inspired by: A local craftsman, named Bryce, who works out of his home.

silimy-toilet-prank,This Is The Most Disgusting Prank Ever,"A harmless prank clogs somebody's toilet with a slimy green ooze. A little salt reverses the effect and the gel becomes flushable.This effect was achieved using diapers, food coloring and salt.For this experiment I collected the super absorbent crystals from 5 of our baby diapers, and mixed them into the toilet water, along with a few drops of green food coloring.Please note that only the crystal power was collected from the diapers, and not the wadding.Within minutes, all the water became a slimy green ooze. I wouldn't recommend trying to flush the toilet at this point as it could cause clogging and overflowing of the toilet bowl.The effects can be reversed with salt.When I learned that common table salt could be used to reverse the retention effects of ""super absorbent crystals"", I experimented in a glass first, then tested it in a toilet. I was very pleased to see that after adding the salt, within minutes, the gel had converted back to a liquid that was harmlessly flushable.--""Quick Clips"" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.For other project videos, check out http://www.thekingofrandom.comMusic by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.comInspired by: Kipkay's ""Crazy Diaper Gag!"" http://youtu.be/Sk8r8Vo4U_MFor more details, check out my similar video ""Diapers Help Your Plants Grow!"": http://youtu.be/sXb8rJ8Rm3IWARNING: This video is for demonstration and entertainment purposes only, and is not intended to be duplicated.

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:To fold the candle, we're going to follow 8 simple steps. 1. Start with a square napkin, and turn it slightly so that one point is facing up. 2. Now take the bottom tip, and fold it up toward the top until the two corners match. This should form a rough triangle.3. The next step is fold the base up just a couple of inches and press it down flat. 4. At this point, we can flip the whole thing over, so the triangle is pointing to the left.5. Take the bottom point and fold it up so the tip is just past the center. 6. Start rolling the whole thing into a tube, starting from the bottom, and working toward the top. When your roll is finished, you might want to push the uneven ends back into the tube, then tuck the loose end, neatly into the cuff. This should give you a nice sturdy base to hold your napkin upright. 7. To finish off, just turn one layer of the tip down.8. Then shape the the other layer to look like a flame. Now your candle looks like it's burning, with a bit of wax dripping off the top. It's completely finished, and ready to impress. Now if you don't have cloth napkins, try making this with a paper napkin instead.

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:We can make the ""Elf Shoe"" in 8 fairly simple steps. 1. Fold a square napkin in half, from the bottom to the top.2. Then fold it again from the top to the bottom. 3. Now find the center, and fold the two sides in, the same way you'd fold a paper airplane. 4. Go ahead and continue this idea, by folding the sides in again, forming a sharp point at the tip. 5. At this point, the two halves can fold over on each other, and when you flatten them out, check which side is open, and make sure it's facing to the bottom. 6. Now focus on the loose parts at the back, and fold the top layer up and out of the way. 7. The bottom layer folds in half, then wraps over the top layer, tucking neatly into the little flap in the side of the shoe. 8. All that's left now, is to turn down the loose material sticking up at the top, to form a little cuff. Your little elf shoe napkin is finished and ready for showing off. If you try making one out of a paper napkin it will probably look something like this. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean."

napkin-rose,Impress The Ladies With This Rose Napkin Origami,"How to fold a square napkin into The ""Rose"". A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:The ""Rose"" can be folded in just 6 easy steps. 1. Get started with a square napkin, and fold each of the 4 corners into the center as best you can. Most napkins aren't perfectly square, but just do the best you can, with what you've got. 2. The next step is to take the 4 new corners, and fold them into the center as well. 3. Now just hold everything together at the middle, and flip the napkin over. 4. Let's repeat the process again, by taking these 4 corners, and folding them into the middle like we did the the others. 5. Ok, we're just about done, so to finish up, hold the center firmly with one hand, and gently pull the tips from underneath the corners, until they look like flower petals. 6. When you've done this to each of the 4 corners, do the same thing, to the undersides of the edges. This will make little points stick out between your rose petals, and give the whole thing a nice symmetrical balance. This adds an amazing decorative flare to your dinner presentation, and if you don't have any cloth napkins, these can look great with paper napkins as well. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean."
