All you need is an old saw blade and you're ready  to become super powered!	A junk table saw blade is up-cycled into a collection of 5 superhero throwing stars.I was amazed and impressed, that with a simple jigsaw, nearly any reasonable shape could be cut from an old saw blade. My first thought was to make a "batarang".Of course it takes a lot of time and patience to make the rounded cuts, and while practicing, I went through more jigsaw blades than I should have, but this was one of my first projects playing with the art of cutting metal and has opened a whole new world of possibilities.--"Quick Clips" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.Music by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.comProject inspired by: "How To Make a Real Ninja Star / Shuriken - The Art Of Weapons" http://youtu.be/_hMXKjdJbTgA junk table saw blade is up-cycled into a collection of 5 superhero throwing stars.I was amazed and impressed, that with a simple jigsaw, nearly any reasonable shape could be cut from an old saw blade.

Building self confidence by positive reinforcement, and by making a simple picture frameWhy my little boy (3.5 at the time) spent some quiet time by himself, we discovered he had got into the paints, and actually painted a picture. It wasn't just a mess, but he actually made something I thought looked really awesome.I wanted to celebrate his accomplishment and make him feel special, so in this project I made a custom picture frame for his little picture, and then for some of the other pictures around the house.--Special thanks to my friends Scott & Brendo for letting me use their song ("Tin Man" - Instrumental).

No more watering your plants constantly with this super soil!	In emergency situations, it's always good to know and understand as many options as possible.I love the idea that simple resources can be utilized to help meet our basic survival needs, or help optimize systems with just a shift in thinking, and repurposing our trash. Water and time are both very important resources, and when both can be conserved with very little effort, it's a major win.The next time you have a damaged or defected diaper that you're just going to throw away, why not rip it apart and try some of these experiments for yourself? Just make sure it hasn't been used for it's original intended purpose first!An adult diaper is used to help plants grow.

When I started building this version, I didn't have any plans, just a basic idea, and kind of put it together as I went. I wanted it to have built in electrical outlets, cabinets, and my flush mount router station. But once I got going with it, I saw where I could put a custom sign, which of course meant I needed to light it. If I was going to install LED lighting for the sign, I thought maybe it would be awesome to install it on the understand of the entire worktop. I found the light set at superbrightleds.com, and in truth, the LED's cost nearly as much as all the wood and materials on the rest of the bench! Hopefully it was worth it.I wanted the bench to look industrial, so I found a 4'x8' sheet of diamond plated aluminum at a local metal/steel company for about $100.00. I used my jigsaw to cut it into strips, and used some 2x8 pine board to bend it to 90º angles for the corners. I'm really happy with how it turned out. It took a lot of time, effort, blood and sweat, but I'm hoping it will be a permanent and useful addition to my project videos. The materials for wood, paint and other accessories was about $400, and the LED strip kit was about $300.00. I can't put a price on my labor, but it was 2 solid weeks, all day every day so I could get it done, and keep making videos without missing an upload.In any case, it's never going anywhere. It won't fit through any door, and the thing probably weighs about 400lbs!I hope you like it!--Project inspired by: A local craftsman, named Bryce, who works out of his home. He gave me a tour of his shop, and had designed a router station very similar to my first prototype.

To get this effect, I took a deep breath in, held it, then poured a small amount of LN2 into my mouth, and blew it out forcefully without hesitation.Assuming that my mouth is approximately 98.6F and liquid nitrogen is -321F, there is a difference of nearly 420F. As the liquid nitrogen contacts my mouth, it is instantly boiled and vaporized, and amazingly doesn't make contact with my mouth at all. The cloud you see blowing out as a cloud is caused from moisture in the air being condensed by the extreme, and sudden, temperature change.There is a danger if larger amounts of LN2 are used, as it could quickly cool the mouth and cause tissue damage.This footage was originally included in my "7 "Super Cool" Demonstrations with Liquid Nitrogen" video: http://youtu.be/KlAl5RHAAns, but was cut out due to some viewer concerns. Presented in this manner, the footage is still accessible, but not implied to be duplicatable.--DANGER: For demonstrational purposes only. Do not try this at home.

The cloud you see blowing out as a cloud is caused from moisture in the air being condensed by the extreme, and sudden, temperature change.There is a danger if larger amounts of LN2 are used, as it could quickly cool the mouth and cause tissue damage.This footage was originally included in my "7 "Super Cool" Demonstrations with Liquid Nitrogen" video: http://youtu.be/KlAl5RHAAns, but was cut out due to some viewer concerns. Presented in this manner, the footage is still accessible, but not implied to be duplicatable.--DANGER: For demonstrational purposes only. Do not try this at home. The Leidenfrost effect is demonstrated using some "Mad Science"."Quick Clips" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.Music by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.comInspired by: "Drinking Liquid Nitrogen" http://youtu.be/R2f1ECjs9fAWARNING: This video is for demonstrational purposes only. Although Liquid Nitrogen isn't readily accessible to the general public, it should always be treated with caution and respect. At a temperature of -321F, it will start to freeze organic matter within seconds. Never drink liquid nitrogen. Use of video content is at own risk.	\N	ledienfrost-experiemnt	7

A harmless prank clogs somebody's toilet with a slimy green ooze. A little salt reverses the effect and the gel becomes flushable.This effect was achieved using diapers, food coloring and salt.For this experiment I collected the super absorbent crystals from 5 of our baby diapers, and mixed them into the toilet water, along with a few drops of green food coloring.Please note that only the crystal power was collected from the diapers, and not the wadding.Within minutes, all the water became a slimy green ooze. I wouldn't recommend trying to flush the toilet at this point as it could cause clogging and overflowing of the toilet bowl.The effects can be reversed with salt.When I learned that common table salt could be used to reverse the retention effects of "super absorbent crystals", I experimented in a glass first, then tested it in a toilet. I was very pleased to see that after adding the salt, within minutes, the gel had converted back to a liquid that was harmlessly flushable.--"Quick Clips" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.For other project videos, check out http://www.thekingofrandom.comMusic by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.comInspired by: Kipkay's "Crazy Diaper Gag!" http://youtu.be/Sk8r8Vo4U_MFor more details, check out my similar video "Diapers Help Your Plants Grow!": http://youtu.be/sXb8rJ8Rm3IWARNING: This video is for demonstration and entertainment purposes only, and is not intended to be duplicated.

It's mind-blowing to think this stuff is in our food! Here's how to make a glowing "magical mud" from ordinary potatoes.When I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck. My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.After only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be. It looks exactly like cornstarch that could be purchased at the store.I was familiar with the idea of making tonic water glow under UV light, so wondered how it would would mix with the starch powder. The result was very gratifying!Project inspired by: A pots and pans sales presentation.

WARNING: This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Pyrotechnics are not toys, and should be handled with extreme caution and respect. Homemade rockets, no matter how small, may not be legal in your area. Resulting damage may not be covered by your insurance. Check city laws and ordinances before attempting. Use of this video content is at your own risk. A viewer on a previous video asked if these types of fuses could be used to make a small rocket, in the same way a visco fuse rocket was made. At the time, I wasn't familiar with what a Visco fuse rocket was, so did some experiments, and came up with these. I've found they shoot around 50-100 feet, many times landing on the roof of my house. The tape needs to be wrapped tightly around the nozzle to get a good launch. If the tape is too loose, the fuel seems to blow out the end and the rocket doesn't go very far. This poses a risk of burning fuse for a few seconds that fly out in all random directions.I experimented in controlled conditions, and away from anything flammable. Safety equipment was on hand at all times.Music by http://www.MachinimaSound.com (Dust Sucker)	\N	bottle-rockets	27

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:To fold the candle, we're going to follow 8 simple steps. 1. Start with a square napkin, and turn it slightly so that one point is facing up. 2. Now take the bottom tip, and fold it up toward the top until the two corners match. This should form a rough triangle.3. The next step is fold the base up just a couple of inches and press it down flat. 4. At this point, we can flip the whole thing over, so the triangle is pointing to the left.5. Take the bottom point and fold it up so the tip is just past the center. 6. Start rolling the whole thing into a tube, starting from the bottom, and working toward the top. When your roll is finished, you might want to push the uneven ends back into the tube, then tuck the loose end, neatly into the cuff. This should give you a nice sturdy base to hold your napkin upright. 7. To finish off, just turn one layer of the tip down.8. Then shape the the other layer to look like a flame. Now your candle looks like it's burning, with a bit of wax dripping off the top. It's completely finished, and ready to impress. Now if you don't have cloth napkins, try making this with a paper napkin instead. It works just as well, as long as your gentle, and are careful not to tear the paper. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.How to fold a square napkin into The "Candle".

Now focus on the loose parts at the back, and fold the top layer up and out of the way. 7. The bottom layer folds in half, then wraps over the top layer, tucking neatly into the little flap in the side of the shoe. 8. All that's left now, is to turn down the loose material sticking up at the top, to form a little cuff. Your little elf shoe napkin is finished and ready for showing off.

Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:The "Rose" can be folded in just 6 easy steps. 1. Get started with a square napkin, and fold each of the 4 corners into the center as best you can. Most napkins aren't perfectly square, but just do the best you can, with what you've got. 2. The next step is to take the 4 new corners, and fold them into the center as well. 3. Now just hold everything together at the middle, and flip the napkin over. 4. Let's repeat the process again, by taking these 4 corners, and folding them into the middle like we did the the others. 5. Ok, we're just about done, so to finish up, hold the center firmly with one hand, and gently pull the tips from underneath the corners, until they look like flower petals. 6. When you've done this to each of the 4 corners, do the same thing, to the undersides of the edges. This will make little points stick out between your rose petals, and give the whole thing a nice symmetrical balance. This adds an amazing decorative flare to your dinner presentation, and if you don't have any cloth napkins, these can look great with paper napkins as well. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.	\N	napkin-rose	35

If you like their music, you can download it here: http://bit.ly/ScottBrendoiTunesInspired by: Intel / McAfee and their request to come up with "digital life" hacks, for methods of creating strong passwords, practical for everyday users. WARNING: The ideas and examples demonstrated in the video are suggestions for practical development of strong memorable passwords based on my personal research and experience. Having a strong password will not guarantee your accounts cannot be compromised. There are many people with many ways to trick you into giving out personal information. See below for links to more information on how you can be better protected. Use of video content is at own risk. Helpful Hints for Extra Security: - Have you already been hacked? .. Contact your web service and follow steps for recovering account. Change passwords to all compromised accounts asap. You can find contact information and guidance at http://www.staysafeonline.org/stay-sa...- Never click the link on an email that asks you to log into your account. For example, if you get an email claiming to be from "Paypal", "eBay" or any other sensitive site asking you to log in, it's probably a phishing scam. To be safe, log into the account by going directly to their website. - Avoid forwarding emails to multiple recipients. Forwarding mass emails is a great way for hackers to collect lists of passwords, and begin phishing for sensitive personal information. To be save, avoid forwarding mass emails, and do not click on links in suspicious emails. - If an email looks suspicious, don't even open it. Why write down passwords on a piece of paper? "Simply, people can no longer remember passwords good enough to reliably defend against dictionary attacks, and are much more secure if they choose a password too complicated to remember and then write it down. We're all good at securing small pieces of paper. I recommend that people write their passwords down on a small piece of paper, and keep it with their other valuable small pieces of paper: in their wallet." —Bruce Schneier, 2005 Like any security measure, super strong passwords will not guarantee you ultimate protection, but these ideas are simple, and are certainly the first line of defense in protecting your accounts.Once again, special thanks to http:/www.intel.com/lifehacks for supporting this project.

(In this case, dry ice!)The dry ice cools the liquid mixture to the point where it takes on the familiar qualities of ice cream.I love this method because it adds a mysterious flowing fog quality to the process that's very visually stimulating, and gratifying.When the fog stops, the dry ice has most likely all sublimated out, but be careful when eating, and watch for any small pieces that may have been missed, and avoid eating them. Because the CO2 sublimates directly into a gas, it's very clean and doesn't leave behind any residue. Dry ice is solid CO2, and as it sublimates through the mix, it forms carbonic acid with some of the water in the mix, giving the ice cream the familiar fizzy carbonated taste that we associate with soda.Dry ice from fire extinguishers? In some cases, yes!. Select fire extinguishers utilize CO2 as the medium for suppressing fires. These types are mainly found in restaurant kitchens, mechanical rooms, and in areas that hold sensitive equipment like computers. CO2 fire extinguishers are usually charged with food grade CO2 and are referred to in terms of pounds. For example, a 5lb CO2 extinguisher is charged with a 5 lb weight of liquid CO2. The extinguisher is then highly pressurized. CO2 fire extinguishers are marked with stickers, or holes punched in the servicing labels. They also have unusually large discharge horns, and no pressure gauges.

Use of video content is at own risk.Inspired by: This was an original idea based off a video I saw on making match rockets: http://youtu.be/q0yfrZkqPxQ From personal experimenting, I found that the homemade fuses from previous projects, burn incredibly fast when enclosed. I wondered what would happen if they were wrapped up tightly in aluminum foil. My guess was they would all burn quickly together and go off with a bang. That's basically what happened. I chose to use just a couple wraps of aluminum foil because the material is light weight and would break fairly easily as the pressure built. I wasn't interested in building a bomb. Just a simple homemade pyrotechnic for festive celebrations, and using materials I already had available.This has the potential to be hazardous to people and property. Common sense, safety, and extreme caution need to be exercised to avoid harm and damage to others.	\N	hot-potato	46

WARNING: Using a giant Fresnel lens poses risks of dangerous UV exposure to eyes. UV or welding goggles should be warn to minimize the risk. Intense concentrated solar energy may generate temperatures upwards of 3,000ºF causing fires and/or burns. This video is for demonstration purposes only, and is not intended to be duplicated. Use of video content is at your own risk.  What is this device? It's called a "Fresnel Lens". My "Solar Scorcher" project was originally inspired by Dan Rojas of GreenPowerScience: http://youtu.be/JkgFk15uBxw (Fresnel Lens Giant "Big Daddy") Kipkay also made one a few years ago he called the "Solar Death Ray": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAT6IR... In this experiment, 2 scrambled eggs were cooked with solar power within 20-40 seconds. I used a black metal cooking pan that was pre-heated and buttered, so when the eggs were added, there was plenty of heat to cook them. If trying to cook eggs sunny side up, it's a bit more difficult because the egg whites reflect a lot of the heat, and don't cook as fast. But pre-heating the pan is a great option before adding the eggs. With scrambled eggs, the yoke is mixed throughout, turning the entire mix a deep yellow. This absorbs heat from the sun a little more readily, and helps it cook faster. I was amazed at the power that could be harnessed from the sun, so I tried building one of these "Solar Death Rays" for myself. I call this device the "Solar Scorcher".

For other project videos, check out http://www.thekingofrandom.com Music by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.com WARNING: There were no fish in this fish pond at the time of this experiment. Sodium is an extremely reactive metal and will produce extreme heat, NaOH, and explosive Hydrogen gas. Molten sodium can be thrown out of the water and cause caustic burns to skin, and damage to eyes. Use of video content is at own risk. Sodium is an extremely reactive metal and the reaction with water produces jets of hydrogen gas below the waterline. When the sodium gets trapped under the piece of wood, enough heat can be generated to boil the water around the metal and actually melt the sodium. If the sodium gets hot enough, the hydrogen jets can ignite and burn. Burning hydrogen makes the temperature rise even faster. The rate of the reaction increases so quickly that an explosion may occur! Molten sodium can be thrown out of the dish and leave burns on skin. Wear goggles and stand behind a safety shield when you're anywhere near this reaction. Inspired by: A friend named Dustin. He said his scout group would put chunks of sodium metal in a wheel barrow full of water, then throw a piece of wood on it to make it explode and blast the wood up into the air.

Alcohol is extremely flammable, and can continue burning while sticking to hands, as well as other objects. This should not be attempted indoors or near anything flammable. Drinking isopropyl alcohol has an immediate effect on the central nervous system. Isopropyl alcohol slows these functions and may shut them down altogether which can lead to coma. Use of video content is at own risk. To get this effect, I soaked a few cotton-balls in 70% isopropyl alcohol and lit them with an open flame from a BBQ ignitor. The flame starts off small, but soon engulfs the entire ball. In low light conditions, a flame up to 6" can be observed rising from the ball. Because the flame rises, holding the ball near the bottom helps minimize the heat to the hand, and in some cases, the flaming ball can be held for extended periods of time with minor discomfort.	\N	alcohol-fireball	56

Music by Jason Shaw (TU-ForeverBelieve) http://www.audionautix.com My friend NightHawkInLight made another version of a vacuum pump. Check it out here: http://youtu.be/UkPLu6mgdWA Project inspired by: This is an original design, based off a picture I once found on a google image search. (I haven't been able to find the picture since) WARNING: Power tools, like a table saw, pose risks of serious injury. Adequate training and experience are required before operating. The results and claims of this pump are based solely on my personal experiences with the one demonstrated in the video. Individual results may vary. The pump is a simple design and not made, or claimed, to be used in any heavy duty operations, or relatively high pressures. Use of this content is at your own risk. I've wanted to build a PVC water pump for awhile, but the check valves were around $10.00 each. That seemed a little steep for a PVC build, so I made my own, which you can see in a different project.  I was inspired on the pump piston and chamber by a picture I saw on a google image search by someone who used the 1-1/4" and 1" sizes of tubes, and he mentioned he cut the grooves for the O-rings on a table saw. That was a new idea to me and gave me the inspiration to put this together. I'm also planning to use this piston design in future projects that require pneumatic and hydraulic pistons. In my testing, the valves work great with air and water. I didn't have any gauges to test the strength of the vacuum so can't say how strong the vacuum would be, but it certainly does create one. While there are some special tools used to create this pump (table saw and forester bit), I believe with a little creativity the pump could be made just as effectively without them, making this a simple and duplicatable design.	\N	diy-pump	57

By doing itself, you can save a ton of money the next time you need one for a DIY	The most expensive parts of a water pump, or DIY Super Soaker, are usually the check valves. In this project, we're making some from scratch, for as little as $0.35 each. http://www.thekingofrandom.com Music by Jason Shaw (TU-GetAMoveOn) http://www.audionautix.com Project inspired by: WaterWolf http://www.sscentral.org/homemade/che... WARNING: The pressure tests and claims made on these check-valves is based solely on my personal experiences with the ones demonstrated in the video. Individual results may vary, and caution and care should be taken when loading the valves with high pressure. The risk of higher pressures is that the balls may be forced from the adaptor, shooting out like projectiles. High pressures may also cause the ball to lock up, preventing normal operation of the valve, or possibly even structural failure of the valve altogether. These valves are not made, or claimed, to be used in any heavy duty operations. Use of this content is at your own risk. I wanted to build a PVC water pump, but the check valves were around $10.00 each. That seemed a little steep for a PVC build, so while looking for alternative options, I settled on this design, which is about the cheapest, while still being practical and useful, that I could imagine. In my testing, the valves work great with air and water. Air pressures up to 60PSI seemed to be fine for normal operation, while pressures above 60PSI occasionally caused the ball to lock into the O-Ring, and required substantial "back-pressure" to unlock it.  If you try using rubber bouncy balls as the valve mechanism, only use them in very low pressure applications like blowing up balloons, and possibly for improvised water guns. Relatively high pressures used with these balls seems to eventually force them out of the adaptor, and can shoot them out at surprising velocities. Overall, I'm really happy with the valves because they can be fit into any part of a PVC system, and can be duplicated quickly, easily, and for very very low cost.	\N	one-way-valve	59

In this project, we're making hand-held sparklers for the 4th of July. When it's time to celebrate with fireworks, you could just buy them. Or you could improvise, and make your own. http://www.thekingofrandom.com **Check out Household Hacker light 200 sparklers at once!: http://youtu.be/1MX5tkXDOSA **Watch CrazyRussianHacker's Underwater Sparkler Experiment: http://youtu.be/BONzS8i86bw How to Make Smoke Flares: http://youtu.be/gNrXrah6ohU Music by http://www.MachinimaSound.com (Dance Of The Pixies)  Project inspired by: How To Make Slow Burning Fuses http://youtu.be/w-H02hwvVgI WARNING: There is a very real risk to health and safety. This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Pyrotechnics are not toys, and should be handled with extreme caution and respect. High temperatures on the stove or oven may cause auto-ignition of the pyrotechnic composition which may lead to serious injury, death, and/or permanent damage to equipment and property. Ignition of an incendiary or explosive material may not be legal in your area, and resulting damage may not be covered by your insurance. Check city laws and ordinances before attempting. Use of this video content is at your own risk.   These sparklers are nearly identical to the slow burning fuses made in a previous project (http://youtu.be/w-H02hwvVgI). The only difference is, this time I tried adding food coloring for effect, and a clothespin as a holder to help prevent burns to fingers. This is the recipe for making a "sparkle stick"; -60 mL Water (Heated on medium heat) -36 grams KNO3 (Potassium Nitrate) which I obtained in the form of stump remover -24 grams White Sugar -1-20 drops of food coloring (Color to suit your preference) Note: White/Gray smoke is the only color emitted, even if you use different colored dyes. Colored smoke cannot be made with KNO3. Shake the Sugar and KNO3 together to get an intimate mixture, then pour into the water and stir until dissolved. Soak about 12 feet of 100% cotton yarn in the solution, then space evenly on a cookie tray. Bake in an oven at 150ºC (300ºF) for about 20 minutes, making sure to lift the yarn at 10 minutes to make sure it doesn't stick to the pan. Let cool for 5-10 minutes. Cut to desired size, and place in clothespin. Put on gloves and safety glasses, light your sparkler, and enjoy! The sparks are much more noticeable at night when there is very little light. During the day, the smoke is more visible. Personally, I think both effects are awesome. Gloves are recommended as bits of burning fuel will occasionally fly off, and can burn the skin. If the sparkler burns too fast, wait a few hours, or days to try again. The composition is hygroscopic and will absorb moisture from the air, reducing the rate of burn until eventually it won't light at all. If you want to revive an old batch that has absorbed too much moisture, re-bake in the oven for 20 minutes at 150ºC (300ºF). These types of devices may not be legal to make or use in your area, so check local laws before attempting to duplicate this project, and as always, be safe and aware of your environment before igniting anything flammable!	\N	diy-sparklers	64

It&#39;s a fitting name since the system acts similar to a Variac. The idea is to use a water based medium as an electrolytic resistor. A bit of electrolyte is added to the solution to make it slightly conductive, and when two electrodes are placed in the solution, the allow more or less current to flow, depending on whether there are closer or further apart.<br /><br />Although I&#39;ve taken thought to minimize risks in operation, I have to stress that I don&#39;t consider this device safe or fool proof. It has the potential to be lethal, and even though I show step-by-step how it was made, this is more of a &quot;How I did&quot; project rather than a &quot;How to&quot;.	\N	scariac	76

Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />In this video I tried making my own copper lugs from pieces of 1/2&quot; copper tubing.  When crimped onto a length of wire, this gives the option of being able to switch around, or replace the electrode wires.<br /><br />The board I used for the transformer platform is 7&quot; x 10&quot;<br /><br />I used a plastic container as a casing for the welder, and a platform for the transformers that was small enough to keep the entire assembly compact.<br /><br />The idea of the Microwave Welder isn&#39;t new, but to date, I personally haven&#39;t come across a video or project where anyone actually welded anything with one.  The most that&#39;s been shown is to lay a bead on a piece of metal, which I didn&#39;t feel was very credible because this doesn&#39;t prove it can weld.  My earlier experiments with 1 MOT could also lay a bead, but it didn&#39;t have enough heat or penetration to make anything stick.  A welder also needs a way to reliably control the amperage (which no other project does).  I saw one project where dimmer switches were used on the primary coils, however dimmer switches are only able to handle around 600 watts, and these stick welders require upwards of 2,000-3,000 watts.  In my experience, the dimmer switches fail very quickly and within a couple minutes of trying to weld.<br /><br />I&#39;m happy to say that the welder in my project does work for me.  It welds 1/16&quot; AC rods very well, and I believe the transformer temperatures are very reasonable and sustainable for the amount of welding I plan to do as a simple hobbiest welder.	\N	arc-welder-2	79

Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />Did you know you can make an AC arc welder using parts from your microwave? <br /><br />I used 2 transformers from 2 different microwaves, and about 50&#39; of 8 AWG stranded copper cable from a local hardware store.  You could probably save some money by scavenging for free wire, but I decided to look at the &quot;end of coil&quot; section at the hardware store, and was able to negotiate a deal for half price on the cable, so the 50&#39; only cost me about $17.<br /><br />The modified MOTs will have a new secondary that is 18 turns of the 8 AWG cable, and both MOTs are tied together in series.  I also found I needed to run the system on 240 volts AC to get the power output for good welding.  My goal was 30+ volts AC with a variable amperage from 0-120+ Amps.<br /><br />There are a few videos on the internet that show various people who have tried making a stick welder from a Microwave Oven Transformer.  There are even a couple of tutorials suggesting how to  do it.

Proper eye protection and ventilation are recommended. I run the system on 240 VAC, which is metered by a power controller I built called the &quot;Scariac&quot;. It&#39;s similar to the idea of a Variac (variable auto-controller), with a few more hazards to be aware of. The Micro-Welder itself does not have an on-off switch, and can pose a fire hazard if plugged directly into a mains power socket. I made this to be used exclusively with the Scariac. (Look for how to build that in another project.) Stick welding, and/or the modification of a Microwave Oven Transformer (M.O.T), can be very dangerous and presents risk of UV radiation, shock hazards, burns, fires, fumes and a multitude of other risks. This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />This video is the end result of 3 other project videos which will be edited and uploaded over the next couple of months. Those videos will show how I modified the transformers, and how to control the current, but they aren&#39;t available at the moment, hence the &quot;Coming Soon&quot; on the annotations.<br /><br /> This project video comes after quite a bit of thinking and experimenting with different ways to modify the microwave stick welder into something that actually works, and would actually be a useful tool to have around the shop.<br /><br />There are a few videos on the internet that show various people who have tried making a stick welder from a Microwave Oven Transformer. There are even a couple of tutorials suggesting how to do it. However, in my experience of trying to duplicate these projects, my MOT welder either got so hot that the insulation on the wires melted and shorted it out, and/or it didn&#39;t provide enough power to strike and maintain an arc.<br /><br />To date, I haven&#39;t seen a video or project where anyone actually welded anything with one of these &quot;so-called&quot; microwave welders. The most that&#39;s been shown is to lay a bead on a piece of metal. But this doesn&#39;t prove it can weld. My earlier attempts could also lay a bead, but they didn&#39;t have enough heat or penetration to make anything stick. A welder also needs a way to reliably control the amperage (which no other project does). I saw one project where dimmer switches were used on the primary coils, however dimmer switches are only able to handle around 600 watts, and these stick welders require upwards of 2,000-3,000 watts. In my experience, the dimmer switches fail very quickly and within a couple minutes of trying to weld.<br /><br />I&#39;m happy to say that the welder in my project does work for me. It welds 1/16&quot; AC rods very well, and I believe the transformer temperatures are very reasonable and sustainable for the amount of welding I plan to do as a simple hobbiest welder.<br /><br />To see exactly how I built this welder, look for Part 1 and Part 2 on how to make the Microwave Stick Welder.	\N	stick-welder	86

It&#39;s more of a novelty than anything practical, but in my experience, the image is watchable and the idea will hopefully be enjoyed.  If anything, it&#39;s a party trick you can pull out for your next get-together with friends.  The image projected on the wall will be &quot;mirror image&quot; or &quot;flipped horizontally&quot; from the original image.  This will make any text or numbers appear backward.  The light from the Laptop, Smartphone or Tablet is the only source of light, so as the image is made bigger, the intensity of the light on the screen gets weaker until eventually the image becomes indiscernible.<br /><br />Project inspired by: This was an original idea.  (That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m the first one to do it, just that the idea is new to me and I haven&#39;t seen it done before.)  While visiting family in 2012, I found that by magnifying the screen of my smartphone through a sphere-shaped water bottle, I could project an image on the wall.  To make a better quality image required a larger magnifier, but a magnifying glass was impractical because it would be so large, heavy and expensive.  A friend requested I do this project for March Madness, so I devoted some time and thought into it, and this is what resulted.<br /><br />The projector is very simple.  It&#39;s made of cardboard, duct-tape, and a Fresnel lens about 7&quot;-10&quot;.<br /><br />I found that using a Laptop works the best, because the screen is larger to begin with, and it can be turned up fairly brightly.  This is good because as the image is made bigger, the intensity of the light on the screen is lessened.  An image of 50&quot; is very watchable on a Laptop, as well as a Tablet about the size of an iPad.  Of course, the closer your bring the projector to the screen, the smaller the image will be, but the brighter and more focused it will become.<br /><br />I found that if you cover all your windows and close any doors to make sure the room is completely dark, this will help the image appear crisper and brighter.  <br /><br />Because the Fresnel lens is made flat, there are some optical disadvantages that appear in the image.  For example, the edges of the screen may be a little blurry while the center is in focus.  To address this problem, a shroud can be added to the lens with a rectangular hole in the center about the size of a credit card.  This will choke down the aperture, and dramatically improve the focus.  The trade off is that there will be less light emitted from the projector, so the image on the screen will be dimmed.<br /><br />A Smartphone works the same way, but the screen size can&#39;t go much over 20&quot; or the image is unwatchable.  15&quot; worked great, and 20&quot; was ok.  Some Smartphones don&#39;t have an option to lock the screen sideways so you may have to download an app for that.	\N	home-theater	90

I had been playing around with making candles with vegetable oil and was about to make a video on some ways to do that.  One night an idea popped into my head about melted butter and I wondered if that would work.<br /><br />WARNING: An open flame poses a fire hazard.  Do not use near any flammable or explosive material.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />To make butter burn, we actually need to vaporize it first!<br /><br />A bit of rolled up toilet paper acts as a wick, and when pushed down into the center of a block of butter and ignited, we&#39;ve may have created the worlds simplest candle.  <br /><br />The butter below the wick begins to melt and soak up into the paper.  The heat aids the liquid butter to be released as a vapor, and it&#39;s the vapor that&#39;s flammable.<br /><br />I used an 8oz block of butter and cut it in half.  Each half burns for about 4 hours each, however, during the last 2 hours it seems most of the butter liquifies and your wick may need some support.  I used a paperclip to give some stability.<br /><br />Another idea would be to cut the butter into 8 sections of 1oz each and make 8 candles!  Each ounce should burn for about 1 hour.</p>	\N	butter-candle	94

(-78C/-109F) and can cause instant frost-bite to exposed skin. This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training. Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br /> It cost just under $30 to refill the tank to get about 2 lbs of dry-ice. Contrasting that with the cost of dry-ice at the local grocery store ($1.00/lb) doesn&#39;t make financial sense, but this method is much more fun!<br /><br />If pressurized liquid CO2 is quickly depressurized, the CO2 expands to a gas, and cools its surroundings. This is called adiabatic cooling. Because the CO2 sublimates directly into a gas, it&#39;s very clean and doesn&#39;t leave behind any residue. <br /><br />Some fire extinguishers utilize CO2 as the medium for suppressing fires. These types are mainly found in restaurant kitchens, mechanical rooms, and in areas that hold sensitive equipment like computers. <br /><br />CO2 fire extinguishers are usually charged with food grade CO2 and are referred to in terms of pounds. For example, a 5lb CO2 extinguisher is charged with a 5 lb weight of liquid CO2. <br /><br />CO2 fire extinguishers are marked with stickers, or holes punched in the servicing labels. They also have unusually large discharge horns, and no pressure gauges.	\N	diy-dry-ice	95

Not only do they launch rockets, and fire clouds of raining candy, they can also be used to fire water balloons .. and these things really fly!<br /><br />I made a simple mod for the Rocket Rifle by attaching a 2&#39; length of 2&quot; PVC tubing, with some reducer fittings, so that it screws into the 1&quot; in-line sprinkler valve.  It&#39;s as easy as that!<br /><br />Testing out some small water balloons from the dollar store, we lost sight of them after a couple hundred feet.  That means these water balloons are blasting over 300 feet away!  Your friends don&#39;t stand a chance!<br /><br />The balloon blasters are powered by compressed air, so to charge the system, you can either hook them up to an air compressor, or modify the valve to accept a bicycle pump.  <br /><br />A manual valve built into the systems allows the air chambers to be charged with air, then closed, trapping the air in the system, and making the balloon cannons completely portable!  You may only get 1 or 2 shots off before having to re-charge however, so strategy will come into play!<br /><br />With the Candy Cannon, I was able to load up 17 water balloons at once!  And rather than just shooting them aimlessly, I targeted my neighbors house.  Hopefully they realize that was just &quot;friendly&quot; fire.	\N	water-balloon-rocket	97

There are no voltage regulators, no diodes and no capacitors to smooth the current.  There may a risk in charging lithium-ion batteries without a proper battery charging circuit recommended by the manufacturer.  It worked fine for me, but if you try this on your phone, make sure you understand, and are comfortable, with the risks.  Back up your data in case your phone is adversely affected and your data or equipment is damaged as a result.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.  By running an electric motor backwards, you can generate electricity.  <br /><br />When using a cordless drill, remove the battery pack so you&#39;re not fighting the back EMF, and press the trigger button in to allow the electrical connection to be made.  Now all you have to do is twist the rotating end of the drill, and you&#39;ll be generating electricity at the contact points where the battery would normally connect.  On my drill, a cranking speed of 100 RPM yielded about 5 volts DC.<br /><br />A few household items will make it practical to use.  For example, a crank handle (made from a mixing beater and a salad fork) will give better leverage for cranking.  Some aluminum foil that&#39;s been rolled up into a wire will help direct the electricity to the point of use.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The faster and harder you can crank the drill, the higher voltage, and more amperage you can extract.  <br /><br />Ideally, this could be hooked up to a bike, water power, or a windmill to generate effortless energy, and if done carefully, the energy could be stored in a battery for later use.	\N	emergency-charger	98

Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />These little rockets are about as simple as they get, and yet they are impressively durable. 1 sheet of computer paper is used to form a spacer and the rocket body, then electrical tape is wrapped up the body to reinforce the tube. Electrical tape works great because it can withstand the 135 PSI pressure from the rocket launcher made in a different project. <br /><br />The fins are made from cardboard, and are about 1/3 as tall as the rocket, and as wide as the width of the body. I use 4 fins because I found that 3 sometimes left the rocket unstable when airborne. 4 fins keep the rocket very straight, and if shot straight up, it can achieve heights that put it out of sight. Trying to catch it on the way back down can result in a red welt on your hand. I speak from experience. <br /><br />The rockets hold together great and can be shot multiple times. I&#39;ve noticed that in time, the glue holding the fins starts to give way and a fin may fall off. The extra wraps of tape over the tips and base of the fins help improve the life of the rocket. If you do lose a fin, They can be hot-glued back on, if you don&#39;t feel like making a whole new rocket. <br /><br />Not bad for about 5¢ worth of materials!	\N	paper-rockets	100

During pyrolysys, gasses such as hydrogen and methane are released from the fabric, and can be ignited and burned. <br /><br />The process of making char cloth is very similar to making wood gas, and the gas released can be captured and burned as fuel.<br /><br />Char cloth can be ignited by a single spark, that can in turn be used to ignite a tinder bundle to start a fire.  Sometimes it&#39;s difficult to ignite tinder directly, and char cloth provides a means that makes the process extremely simple.	\N	charcloth	104

By turning the bottle upside down and using the rounded convex part at the top, we can use a water bottle as a make-shift magnifying lens.  <br /><br />The curved water refracts the sunlight, and give the ability to focus it.  The closer the rounded lens is to resembling a liquid sphere, the better it will work.  If bubbled are trapped in the bottle, they will distort the sunlight and weaken the intensity of the beam.<br /><br />This technique isn&#39;t easy, and takes a lot of practice to master, so don&#39;t wait until you&#39;re in a survival situation to try it.	\N	fire-water-bottle	105

Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />NOTE: <br /><br />This is not a &quot;free energy&quot; device, &quot;over unity&quot; device, or a claim to be the solution to the worlds energy crisis.  This is a project I did to experiment with the electrolysis of water, and the resulting gasses collected.<br /><br />I have not tried this HHO fuel to operate engines, although many people claim they have done it with success.<br /><br />ABOUT: <br /><br />The generator requires electricity to electrolyze H2O (water) into gas.  The resulting mixed gas is H2 and O2.  I typically hook this up to my car battery while the vehicle is running, so the alternator takes most of the load.  On 12 volts I get about 1.5 liters/minute, but when I want to make the gas faster, I hook 2 car batteries in series for 24 volts, and this exponentially increases the gas production to over 5 liters per minute.<br /><br />Current draw seems to be around 20-50 amps depending on whether you use 12-24 volts.  High current draws mean the electrolyte heats up, and if left too long the plastic can warp or melt causing structural failure.<br /><br />Some people ask why the plates aren&#39;t all electrically connected.  The plates that aren&#39;t connected are called &quot;floater&quot; plates, or &quot;neutral&quot; plates.  There is too much information to post about them here, so do a google search, or check out websites like <a href="http://www.hho4free.com/neutral_plates.htm" target="_blank" title="http://www.hho4free.com/neutral_plates.htm" rel="nofollow" dir="ltr" class="yt-uix-redirect-link">http://www.hho4free.com/neutral_plate...</a> for an in depth explanation of the theory.<br /><br />I used KOH as my electrolyte because research suggested it was the best.  I haven&#39;t experimented with other electrolytes, but have heard that salt, sodium hydroxide, vinegar, etc could work, but will dirty and may corrode the plates.  Potassium Hydroxide keeps the system clean, however, it is caustic, so be careful if you choose to use it.  You can probably get away with about 2-4 teaspoons of KOH per 6 liters of water.<br /><br />This system produces an extremely powerful OxyHydrogen gas.  When the gas is used, it simply turns back into water, and that&#39;s good for the environment.  However I believe it takes more electric energy to produce the gas than is obtained from the gas.  This device merely converts the energy from one form to another, with given losses.<br /><br />As long as you have enough electricity, the amount of water already in this system is enough to produce thousands and thousands of liters of fuel.  Some people say this is the fuel of the future.  Either way, it&#39;s a very powerful gas!<br /><br />If you need more information, or want to purchase build plans for this design, send an email request to grant@thekingofrandom.com.	\N	water-explosive	106

If copper wire is an issue, the TV hacking, and wire from the sump pump motor is to demonstrate that copper wire is everywhere, not just in stores.<br /><br />WARNING: Do not try hacking your TV at home.  The capacitors may hold a charge and pose a risk of electric shock.  This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.

Colored liquids, or liquids in colored bottles can still work, but energy is lost, and that could be the difference between getting tinder ignition or not.<br /><br />After making fires with various water bottles, and posting my first video on it in 2010, someone commented and said they saw a guy on Dual Survival do it with his urine. That sounded pretty amazing to me, so I looked up the link on YouTube and saw the clip.<br /><br />It seemed like he had quite a bit of trouble actually getting his fire going, and I thought that if I were ever in a survival situation like that, the last thing I would want to be doing is trying for hours how to figure out how it works. It&#39;s better to be prepared beforehand.<br /><br />This video comes after many experiments of playing with various techniques. I found that using plastic wrap and urine made a combination that gave great success, and within a minute or two I could have a flame! When done correctly, it works just the same as a magnifying glass. <br /><br />Practicing with the amount of pressure is key, because too little and you won&#39;t have a good lens. Too much, and the plastic bursts and you&#39;re soaking wet.<br /><br />FAQ&#39;s: <br /><br />Q: Why did I wrap an apple in plastic wrap?<br /><br />A: Of course the video is fictional, however the survival techniques portrayed are real. I wrapped my apple with plastic wrap because I&#39;ve seen it done before at hotels, and I wanted to give an example of how random resources can be used as tools. If you don&#39;t wrap your apples in plastic wrap, perhaps you wrap your sandwich, or various other food items? The plastic baggie holding the celery can also be used in a very similar manner.<br /><br />Q: Why did I use a page from the map for tinder instead of grass or leaves? <br /><br />A: This liquid lens technique will light any tinder that could be lit with a magnifying glass, since that&#39;s what it is in essence. I used a piece of paper as an example because most people have access to that as a material they could practice with. I chose paper because it&#39;s easily duplicatable by anyone wanting to try. <br /><br />Q: Why does the urine change color just before I light the tinder? Did I cheat?<br /><br />A: The urine changes color mid video, and that&#39;s because when I went to re-set my camera for a different angled shot, I dropped the first sack of urine. Awkward to hold the sack, and adjust the camera on rocky terrain at the same time. I lost my urine and had to wait for another round .. which, by that point was more hydrated because of all the water I&#39;d drank earlier, and therefore more clear in color. In either case, I have the same success igniting tinder with either liquid lens so the difference made by the color is negligible.	\N	pee-fire	108

It works because rapid compression heats the air in the chamber to the ignition point of tinders, such as char cloth. The tinder can then be used to ignite kindling, and develop a flame.<br /><br />It&#39;s thought that the fire piston may have inspired Rudolf Diesel in his creation of the diesel engine around 1892.<br /><br />I had a fire piston I made out of copper tubing, but I wanted to make one out of clear acrylic so I could actually see the ignition of the tinder. It seemed it mystery how, or when, it actually lit, and I wanted to see. <br /><br />FINDING ACRYLIC: I used google.com to find different plastics companies in my area, and called around until I found one that sold acrylic tubing and rods to the public. I went for a visit, and luckily they had some lengths of scrap tubing they couldn&#39;t sell. I asked them if I could use it for a science project, and they gave it to me for free.<br /><br />The tubing I used was 1/2&quot; inside diameter, and the rod was 1/2&quot; outside diameter - clear acrylic. <br /><br />This piston was given to a subscriber, as part of a contest I held in celebration of 10,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel. <br /><br />See more information on the fire piston on Wikipedia; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston" target="_blank" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston" rel="nofollow" dir="ltr" class="yt-uix-redirect-link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_piston</a>	\N	slam-rod	109

Enough to melt spots of concrete into glowing orange liquid.  <br /><br />I&#39;m curious to see what I can do with all this heat so I&#39;ve filled a glass bottle with water and I&#39;ll punch a hole in the cap.  It&#39;s incredible to see that the instant I focus my lens on the bottle, it starts smoking.  Just a few moments later this water is so hot it&#39;s boiling, and I&#39;m a little nervous the bottle might blow.  Yep, there it goes.  I&#39;ll try burning a penny, and, wow, it melted.  How about a stack of pennies?  Yep, they&#39;re nothing but liquid metal now, and I&#39;m thinking that slag in the mixture must be what&#39;s left of the copper coating.  It&#39;s only taking about 4 seconds to melt these.  <br /><br />Well, I&#39;m convinced there&#39;s an insane amount of power behind these lenses.

BOOM!<br /><br />In a previous project, I built a generator that uses electricity to convert water into a very powerful fuel.  The amount of electricity available determines how much gas can be produced.  I&#39;ve got this hooked up to my car battery and have produced up to 5 liters per minute.  I&#39;ve even tried powering it with a makeshift hand-crank generator, but obviously the gas production is slower.  So just how powerful is the gas?  Watch the video to find out!<br /><br />The gas is just a mixture of the H2O molecules broken down into their gaseous elements of two parts Hydrogen and one part Oxygen, which combine as H2 and O2 gas.  This is sometimes called HHO, or Hydroxy gas.  I used a bbq ignitor to see if the bubbles will pop.  <br /><br />Some people might ask what the purpose of the bubbler is.  It helps clean the gas, but more importantly, it acts as a flame arrestor in the event of a flashback.  The bubbler cap is just pressed on, so if there&#39;s a tiny flashback explosion, the worst thing that happens is the cap pops off.  If the bubbler&#39;s a little low on fluid then be careful, because now the gas has a place to build up, and if you were to get a flashback in this situation, it could be a little more dramatic.  It&#39;s helpful to keep the bubbler full, so I made mine detachable for ease of use.	\N	explosive-water	115

It&#39;s probably my technique, which I hope I can master over time, but I&#39;ve found very little information on the subject, and nobody who&#39;s actually done it with wood other than hibiscus or sotol.	\N	stick-fire	116

Copper ions gain electrons (reduced) while zinc ions give them up (oxidized).  = (redox)<br /><br />An electrolyte like salt water or vinegar helps get the metals into ions.

At this point, the mixture is just runny enough that it can be coaxed into the container.  It takes about 60 grams to fill this red block, and when I&#39;ve cooked up a little more, I&#39;ll add that to the blue one.  It&#39;s darker in color because it cooked longer, and generally speaking, I think the less it is cooked, the better.  <br /><br />Another batch was made using a mix of 58% Stump Remover, 29% Sugar, and this time I used 13% Corn syrup, and 30mL water.  The water was cooked out the same way as the last, and then about 1 gram of homemade rust powder was added, and stirred in throughly.  When it was ready, it looked like a creamy chocolate frosting, and I packed that into the green LEGO.  I may have accidentally trapped an air bubble inside.  <br /><br />Overall I think I&#39;m happiest with these mixtures using the rust.  With a different homemade casing that actually has a nozzle, I was able to get a successful rocket launch that I think went a couple thousand feet high.	\N	rocket-fuel	120

Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in severe electric shock, cardiac arrest, serious injury, permanent damage to equipment and property, and/or death. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />By modifying the secondary coil on a MOT, the transformer is converted from a high voltage/low current device into a low voltage/high current metal melter.  The first MOT in the video produces just over 500 amps, and the second one is capable of nearly 800 amps.  <br /><br />Any metal that can conduct such low voltage electricity acts as a resistor between the electrode wires, and heats up due to the extreme electrical friction.<br /><br />I plan to make a new project turning this into a more proper and useful spot welder, although I can find very little use for a spot welder at the moment.	\N	melt-metal	122

This project is extremely dangerous and should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.  Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in severe electric shock, cardiac arrest, serious injury, permanent damage to equipment and property, and/or death. Use of this video content is at your own risk.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: If you attempt to duplicate this project, I suggest wearing THICK INSULATED RUBBER GLOVES, and using a piece of PVC TUBING for your chicken/safety stick.  The gloves I wore, as well as the wooden safety stick, are poor insulators and I used them only because they were what I had on hand, and I was aware and comfortable with the risks, but I cannot recommend they will protect from electric shock.  In any case, always keep one hand behind your back when dealing with HV to reduce the risk of an electrical current from traveling through your heart and sending you into cardiac arrest.<br /><br />By tapping into the secondary coil of an unmodified Microwave Oven Transformer (MOT), and hooking up to a makeshift diverging spark-gap, it&#39;s possible to extract a visible short circuit!<br /><br />These high voltage arcs are probably over an amp in current, and at over 1,000 volts, can be instantly fatal if touched.  <br /><br />As the arc is formed, the surrounding air is ionized and heated, causing the arc to rise.  It will travel up the diverging spark gap, sometimes called a &quot;Jacob&#39;s ladder&quot; until the arc is so weak it breaks.<br /><br />This project is dangerous and isn&#39;t of much practical use as far as I can tell, but was a way to visibly see electricity in plasma form.<br /><br />Because the MOT is unballasted, you can expect the current draw to get so high that the breaker will trip every-time if allowed to continue for an extended period of time.	\N	jacobs-ladder	123
