I have had over 1.5 million people subscribe to my channel and my videos have been viewed over 80 million times!</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, I’ve worked with the biggest DIY channels such as Kipkay, Crazy Russian Hacker and Household Hacker. I get excited about the fact that I am able to collaborate with such inspirational folks who are passionate about DIY and want to spread the DIY spirit to the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>This site, TheKingofRandom.com is the place where I share with you my path to becoming a DIYer (when I first started, I knew nothing about DIY and had nothing except for my curiosity - it’s been a wild ride!). This is the place for me to share my DIY knowledge, and give you a little bit of behind-the-scenes into the YouTube world.</p>\n\n<p>Life is all about a quest for knowledge - in exploring the world around us, and how it works. I hope that my videos, and especially this website inspire in you a sense of daring curiosity and prompt you to test, experiment, make, build, and create with the things around you.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to my website!</p>\n\n<p>Best Regards,<br>\nGrant Thompson</p>\n	\N

Water and time are both very important resources, and when both can be conserved with very little effort, it's a major win.The next time you have a damaged or defected diaper that you're just going to throw away, why not rip it apart and try some of these experiments for yourself? Just make sure it hasn't been used for it's original intended purpose first!An adult diaper is used to help plants grow. The new "super soil" cuts watering amounts, and times, in half, and can grow seeds up to 10 days without any extra water at all.See the full project video here: http://bit.ly/DiapersForPlants--This "Quick Clip" is based off a project video I did last October (http://bit.ly/DiapersForPlants) and the purpose is to bring attention back to it now that the season is more appropriate."Quick Clips" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.Music by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.comInspired by: Kipkay (Crazy Diaper Gag!): http://youtu.be/Sk8r8Vo4U_Mand Steve Spangler (The Baby Diaper Secret - Sick Science! #018): http://youtu.be/VTU3JNAlOG8In emergency situations, it's always good to know and understand as many options as possible.I love the idea that simple resources can be utilized to help meet our basic survival needs, or help optimize systems with just a shift in thinking, and repurposing our trash.

Happy Easter!2 years ago I built this candy cannon for my boys 3rd birthday. It's become a tradition for birthday parties, but this year I thought it would be fun to bust it out for other occasions .. in this case, Easter!Now the candy cannon doubles as an easter egg shooter. Depending on the pressure and angle, it could be used to fire eggs all over the property, making for an instant easter egg hunt :)The kids loved it, and we'll probably be doing it again. Oh yeah, the cannon launches the bunny at amazing speed as well.See how to build the Candy Cannon: http://bit.ly/CandyCannonHappy Easter!--Music by Scott & Brendo ("Higher" -- Instrumental).

2014-05-10 17:07:55.979808	\N	29	An Epic DIY Workbench… With Mood Lighting	When I started building this version, I didn't have any plans, just a basic idea, and kind of put it together as I went. I wanted it to have built in electrical outlets, cabinets, and my flush mount router station. But once I got going with it, I saw where I could put a custom sign, which of course meant I needed to light it. If I was going to install LED lighting for the sign, I thought maybe it would be awesome to install it on the understand of the entire worktop. I found the light set at superbrightleds.com, and in truth, the LED's cost nearly as much as all the wood and materials on the rest of the bench! Hopefully it was worth it.I wanted the bench to look industrial, so I found a 4'x8' sheet of diamond plated aluminum at a local metal/steel company for about $100.00. I used my jigsaw to cut it into strips, and used some 2x8 pine board to bend it to 90º angles for the corners. I'm really happy with how it turned out. It took a lot of time, effort, blood and sweat, but I'm hoping it will be a permanent and useful addition to my project videos. The materials for wood, paint and other accessories was about $400, and the LED strip kit was about $300.00. I can't put a price on my labor, but it was 2 solid weeks, all day every day so I could get it done, and keep making videos without missing an upload.In any case, it's never going anywhere. It won't fit through any door, and the thing probably weighs about 400lbs!I hope you like it!--Project inspired by: A local craftsman, named Bryce, who works out of his home. He gave me a tour of his shop, and had designed a router station very similar to my first prototype. He gave me permission to use the idea, and make modifications.When I started building this version, I didn't have any plans, just a basic idea, and kind of put it together as I went.

To get this effect, I took a deep breath in, held it, then poured a small amount of LN2 into my mouth, and blew it out forcefully without hesitation.Assuming that my mouth is approximately 98.6F and liquid nitrogen is -321F, there is a difference of nearly 420F. As the liquid nitrogen contacts my mouth, it is instantly boiled and vaporized, and amazingly doesn't make contact with my mouth at all. The cloud you see blowing out as a cloud is caused from moisture in the air being condensed by the extreme, and sudden, temperature change.There is a danger if larger amounts of LN2 are used, as it could quickly cool the mouth and cause tissue damage.This footage was originally included in my "7 "Super Cool" Demonstrations with Liquid Nitrogen" video: http://youtu.be/KlAl5RHAAns, but was cut out due to some viewer concerns.

A little salt reverses the effect and the gel becomes flushable.This effect was achieved using diapers, food coloring and salt.For this experiment I collected the super absorbent crystals from 5 of our baby diapers, and mixed them into the toilet water, along with a few drops of green food coloring.Please note that only the crystal power was collected from the diapers, and not the wadding.Within minutes, all the water became a slimy green ooze. I wouldn't recommend trying to flush the toilet at this point as it could cause clogging and overflowing of the toilet bowl.The effects can be reversed with salt.When I learned that common table salt could be used to reverse the retention effects of "super absorbent crystals", I experimented in a glass first, then tested it in a toilet. I was very pleased to see that after adding the salt, within minutes, the gel had converted back to a liquid that was harmlessly flushable.--"Quick Clips" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.For other project videos, check out http://www.thekingofrandom.comMusic by Jason Shaw (RP-Clattertrap) http://www.audionautix.comInspired by: Kipkay's "Crazy Diaper Gag!" http://youtu.be/Sk8r8Vo4U_MFor more details, check out my similar video "Diapers Help Your Plants Grow!": http://youtu.be/sXb8rJ8Rm3IWARNING: This video is for demonstration and entertainment purposes only, and is not intended to be duplicated.

Here's how to make a glowing "magical mud" from ordinary potatoes.When I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck. My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.After only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be. It looks exactly like cornstarch that could be purchased at the store.I was familiar with the idea of making tonic water glow under UV light, so wondered how it would would mix with the starch powder. The result was very gratifying!Project inspired by: A pots and pans sales presentation. They peeled some potatoes to make us dinner, and I noticed the white residue at the bottom of the dish and asked if I could take it home.--WARNING: This substance can make quite a mess, so make it in an area that will be easy to clean up.

I found it works with hamburger and taco wrappers as well!I've used this little trick throughout my life, and, most memorably, one time in Hawaii when my girlfriend (at the time) went out to lunch with me.

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:To fold the candle, we're going to follow 8 simple steps. 1. Start with a square napkin, and turn it slightly so that one point is facing up. 2. Now take the bottom tip, and fold it up toward the top until the two corners match. This should form a rough triangle.3. The next step is fold the base up just a couple of inches and press it down flat. 4. At this point, we can flip the whole thing over, so the triangle is pointing to the left.5. Take the bottom point and fold it up so the tip is just past the center. 6. Start rolling the whole thing into a tube, starting from the bottom, and working toward the top. When your roll is finished, you might want to push the uneven ends back into the tube, then tuck the loose end, neatly into the cuff. This should give you a nice sturdy base to hold your napkin upright. 7. To finish off, just turn one layer of the tip down.8. Then shape the the other layer to look like a flame. Now your candle looks like it's burning, with a bit of wax dripping off the top. It's completely finished, and ready to impress. Now if you don't have cloth napkins, try making this with a paper napkin instead.

A special napkin trick for fancy holiday dinners!WARNING: Dinner guests may become overly intimidated by your amazing napkin folding skills. Use of video content is at own risk.Instructions:The "Rose" can be folded in just 6 easy steps. 1. Get started with a square napkin, and fold each of the 4 corners into the center as best you can. Most napkins aren't perfectly square, but just do the best you can, with what you've got. 2. The next step is to take the 4 new corners, and fold them into the center as well. 3. Now just hold everything together at the middle, and flip the napkin over. 4. Let's repeat the process again, by taking these 4 corners, and folding them into the middle like we did the the others. 5. Ok, we're just about done, so to finish up, hold the center firmly with one hand, and gently pull the tips from underneath the corners, until they look like flower petals. 6. When you've done this to each of the 4 corners, do the same thing, to the undersides of the edges. This will make little points stick out between your rose petals, and give the whole thing a nice symmetrical balance. This adds an amazing decorative flare to your dinner presentation, and if you don't have any cloth napkins, these can look great with paper napkins as well. --Credits:Music by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.comProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.	\N	napkin-rose	58
